title: Nuclear energy is low-carbon energy

description: >
  The nuclear fission reactions that underlie nuclear energy don't create any CO₂
  whatsoever. However, some is emitted during planning, mining, construction,
  operation, decommissioning, and waste disposal. Countless studies have
  analyzed this full cradle-to-grave lifecycle, establishing a powerful
  consensus that nuclear power is indeed low-carbon energy.

For reference, solar photovoltaic lifecycle emissions are around 40 gCO₂-eq/kWh.

Fossil fuel and biofuel energy systems work by combusting a carbon-based fuel
in the presence of oxygen. A reaction between molecular electrons occurs,
forming CO₂, water, and energy, among other combustion products. Excess CO₂
in the atmosphere causes excess energy from the sun to be captured, causing
global warming. The basic equation for combustion is:

$$\text{Hydrocarbon} + \text{O}_2 + \text{spark} \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_{2} + \text{energy}$$

Nuclear energy systems work by breaking nuclear bonds in uranium via neutron-induced
fission chain reactions. The basic equation is:

$$\text{Uranium} + \text{neutron} \rightarrow \text{2 fission products} + \text{energy}$$

The small amount of carbon emissions related to nuclear then come from different
aspects of the overall lifecycle. An example of where exactly the carbon
emissions come from may be found in [Vattenfall's lifecycle analysis](https://group.vattenfall.com/dk/siteassets/danmark/om-os/baeredygtighed/vattenfall-lca-brochure.pdf):

## Zero carbon or low carbon?

It's reasonable to claim that processes that don't inherently require the
production of CO₂ to be zero-carbon processes, including solar photovoltaic,
hydropower, wind, and nuclear. As we continue decarbonizing, energy systems
that use these will be increasingly closer to zero carbon systems. They're zero
carbon in the asymptote.

No energy system today is truly zero-carbon because of all the carbon-based energy
we still use. It's reasonable to call anything with under 50 g CO₂-eq/kWh a low-carbon
energy source.

**Heads up:** Anti-nuclear institutions and groups have made several attempts to
cast doubt on the low-carbon nature of nuclear power. One tried including the
carbon impact of nuclear war. Several such studies have been formally retracted
from their journals.
