The [freely downloadable
book](https://www.energy.gov/management/downloads/hewlett-and-holl-atoms-peace-and-war),
_Atoms for Peace and War_ By Richard Hewlett and Jack Holl is an official Atomic
Energy Commission history covering the Eisenhower years from 1953 to 1961. It
explains the early efforts to build up an economical peaceful nuclear industry and
shows how these efforts coincided with an increasing public understanding of the
dangers of fallout from nuclear weapons. A long read (733 pages), this is something
that any serious student of nuclear history will find fascinating.

This page is a collection of some notes I took while reading, augmented with a few
relevant links. I read it
primarily from the perspective of understanding the development of commercial nuclear
reactors and took more notes on topics relevant to this interest.

# The First few Chapters

Eisenhower was elected on November 4, 1952. He was elected only 72 hours after the
US successfully detonated the world's first thermonuclear weapon, [Ivy
Mike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_mike). Thus, the Eisenhower administration
and the possibility of thermonuclear war were born almost simultaneously. The book
opens as president-elect Eisenhower is briefed on thermonuclear weapons on November 11.
From the beginning, the utterly devastating potential destruction of such weapons
motivated Eisenhower to direct the world in a peaceful direction. The stakes of peace
were now higher than ever.

Eisenhower also heard in this briefing that the first generation of electricity had occurred
in the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I in 1951, that a land-based prototype of a
nuclear-powered submarine was nearing completion at the national reactor testing
station in Idaho, and that nuclear-powered aircraft were under development at the Oak
Ridge National Lab. Four joint ventures between industrial teams and the AEC had
been proposed to develop commercial nuclear power plants. The AEC was trying to
figure out how to release commercial nuclear technology without giving certain
private companies undue advantages over others in the free market.

Eisenhower was the first Republican president in 20 years, and he was determined to
find ways to kick-start commercial nuclear power in a way that would bolster private
industry and reduce the concentration of power and knowledge in the federal
government.

Economic nuclear power was thought promising, but known to be far off. Submarine
power would be the first large-scale use, since the capabilities of nuclear power
underwater have no competition. Finding ways to make nuclear power competitive with
conventional power plants became a primary focus. The [Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress_Joint_Committee_on_Atomic_Energy)
was also keenly interested in this, and in 1952 compiled a 400-page volume of
information, [Atomic Power and Private
Enterprise](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001108568). At the time, it was
thought that one way to get private industry involved would be to make "dual-purpose"
reactors that made heat/electricity for utility purposes and could sell Plutonium
byproducts to the AEC for use in weapons. (This dual-purpose idea was soon thereafter
dismissed because the production reactors at Hanford and Savannah River made
sufficient quantities).

Sidenote, another few hundred pages of [testimony from 1953 is also a wonderful
read](https://archive.org/details/atomicpowerdevel00unit/page/n9).

Budget cuts were a big deal in 1953, and the military's refusal to specify firm
requirements on aircraft carrier nuclear propulsion led to the suggestion to shift
the prototype project to a commercial demonstration. By removing the naval
requirements, $60 million could be saved. Thus, the [Shippingport
reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippingport_Atomic_Power_Station) became the
first commercial-scale demo of a nuclear power plant.

The Shippingport project was done largely in the open, and thousands of design and
testing documents were released to the public. For example, here is a [600-page
summary of the Shippingport reactor.

# The President and the Bomb

After the Soviet Union tested nuclear weapons in 1949, [Edward
Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller) led the effort to accelerate the
development of thermonuclear/hydrogen bombs. The life-and-death issues surrounding
nuclear weaponry aroused passions and emotions among the few who were aware of the
situation at the time, and deep divisions in the scientific community eventually
spilled over into politics. Driven by daily fear of the Soviet Union, Teller was not
convinced that the Los Alamos weapons lab under Oppenheimer was serious enough about
thermonuclear weapons and advocated in 1952 for the creation of a new weapons lab for
thermonuclear research. This eventually came to pass as the [Lawrence Livermore
National Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory).

Page 37 describes _The Wheeler Incident_ where a detailed summary of the design and
operation of [thermonuclear weapons mysteriously disappeared on a
train](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4364).

43: A Disarmament Panel led by Oppenheimer knew that the stockpiles of nuclear
weapons and the destructive power of each weapon was growing at disastrous rates in
the US and Soviet Union. The policy of massive retaliation only lead to a destruction
of civilization. The people at large were not aware of these implications in 1953,
and [the panel
recommended](https://archive.org/details/AMEMORANDUMOFTHEPANELOFCONSULTANTSONDISARMAMENTOFTHEDEPARTMENTOFSTATERDP80B01676R000600030001-4/page/n107)
"a policy of candor toward the American people" describing how terrifying nuclear war
and the arms race were.

  <figure>
  <img src="/img/atoms-peace-candor.jpg" alt="Excerpt from disarmament report suggesting to scare the hell out of Americans about nuclear war" class="img img-fluid center-block " >
  </figure>

Eisenhower was taken by the suggestion to be more candid with Americans and the world
about the dangers of nuclear war. This concept drew Oppenheimer's old rivals back
together, thinking it was essential to continue to build more and larger bombs to
beat the Soviets.

Around this time, Lewis Strauss became Eisenhower's special assistant on atomic
energy. Strauss was solidly in the camp against Oppenheimer and disarmament.
Increasingly powerful Oppenheimer opponents were alarmed by derogatory information in
Oppenheimer's security file, where close family members were revealed to be
communists. Eventually, an inaccurate and oversimplified hit piece against
Oppenheimer was published in Fortune. The Borden Letter came after, which directly
accused Oppenheimer of being an agent of the Soviet Union.

The resulting hearing for revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance produced
thousands of pages of information revealing lots of personal things about scientists
from the Manhattan project days. [Nineteen full volumes of
testimony](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/hearing) are now available for all to peruse.
This testimony includes thing like first-hand accounts of the meetings where Teller
first discussed his thermonuclear design ideas with the top weapons scientists.

The book goes into elaborate detail about personal interactions along these lines for
at least a hundred pages...Notably, Teller's testimony gave him a bad reputation
in the scientific community.

A conflict in the administration grew. Eisenhower was very serious about Operation
Candor, and Strauss wouldn't attack it directly, though he disagreed with it.

Skipping forward, we reach the point where I started taking better notes!

# The Political Arena

124 As policy questions regarding reactor development and weapons testing grew, the
nature of the AEC inevitably shifted from a clear and focused military mission of
producing weapons material and weapons questions of a political nature. The AEC
engaged in international affairs and domestic economic matters.

135 The term _special nuclear materials_ replaced _fissionable materials_ in a bill
in order to cover things like tritium or deuterium.

# Nuclear Weapons: A New Reality

154-155 In some of the high-yield weapons tests in Nevada during
[Upshot-Knothole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Upshot%E2%80%93Knothole), dose rates from fallout reached 0.46
roentgens/hour and Graves ordered road-blocks to be set up and washed some contaminated cars at government expense. The
_Harry_ shot cause the most serious fallout. Local schools kept children indoors and the community at St. George came
to a standstill for several hours. The community was tense.

157 After the _Simon_ shot was unexpectedly 43 kilotons of yield, sheepmen reported
heavy losses west of Cedar City, UT. Thousands of sheep died. Worried that the
concern would prevent most continental testing, the AEC perpetrated a fraud upon the
court by suppressing opinions of some scientists. The court found in favor of the
government in 1955 based on expert testimony. In 1982 the same judge vacated the
decisions as the fraud became clear.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
In my mind, this kind of fraud likely lead to the overall decline in the public's
trust of experts in general, and especially with respect to radiation!
</div>

172 On March 1, 1954, the first [test of of a dry thermonuclear weapon
occurred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_bravo). Unlike the Mike shot, this
_Castle Bravo_ test used Lithium-Deuteride fuel, which had significantly reduced
tritium requirements, and did not require the vast cryogenic equipment that _Mike_
required. The yield was 15 megatons, nearly 1000 times larger than the atomic bombs
from World War II. The fallout was immense, heavily contaminating parts of the nearby
atolls and the Japanese fishing ship, _[Lucky
Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Fukury%C5%AB_Maru)_. _Castle Bravo_
remains to this day the most powerful weapon ever detonated by the USA.

179 The success of the dry device allowed the weapons production complex to reduce
capacity for tritium production at Savannah River and shift it to plutonium
production.

181 Beyond the joy of a successful test program, the test brought a new terror
to life, as the menace of city-destroying weapons was now coupled to radioactive
fallout clouds thousands of miles long.

  </figure>

182 On March 31, 1954, Strauss told the world that the bomb could take out any city, even
New York. This made headlines. General Fields described the fallout danger lucidly:

{:.blockquote}

# Nuclear power for the marketplace

185 Further consideration of "dual-purpose" weapons-producing commercial reactors was
rejected by Hafstad in 1953: "the blunt fact seems to be that we are now too late for the
'dual purpose' approach and too early for the 'power only' approach.

194 Commissioner Murray concluded:

{:.blockquote}

> "For years, the splitting atom, packaged in weapons has been our main shield
> against the Barbarians --- now, in addition, it is to become a God-given instrument
> to do the constructive work of mankind."

195-196 In 1953, the AEC was thinking of commercializing the fast breeder, the
boiling-water experiments from Argonne, and the fluid-fuel homogeneous reactor
experiments from Oak Ridge. A sodium-graphite reactor was pursued by a private
company, and the pressurized-water reactor effort was government-sponsored with some
private industry participation. They expected the PWR to be closest to short-term
success, but it produced poor long-term prospects for producing economic nuclear
power. The BWR was expected to be more promising from an economical point of view.
The Sodium Graphite reactor would be built on private land in Santa Susana, A.
Argonne planned a second experimental breeder in Idaho. ORNL planned a modest second
homogeneous reactor experiment. These last two were expected to become the most
economical systems in the future.

The report explaining these prospects is 130 pages long, but I cannot find it.

201 Nichols sent the Commission a paper in 1954 suggesting a Power Demonstration
Reactor program where private companies could design, build, and operate their own
NPPs with limited assistance and funding from the AEC. The AEC would provide the
fuel for 7 years and take the used fuel back, but would charge for any fissile
material consumed in reactor. This was quickly approved and had far-reaching
implications in the development of the nuclear industry.

204 People were really excited about developing nuclear power to help the world.

Pastore said:

{:.blockquote}

> Are we not trying to win the hearts and minds of people in other parts of the world?
> That is the great inspiration that was given to the world in the speech made by
> the President. Are we winning that race?

205 In Sprint 1955, 4 proposals for industry were received for the Power
Demonstration Reactor Program:

- NPG with a 180 MW BWR in Chicago
- Detroit Edison with a 100 MW fast breeder in Detroit
- Yankee Atomic Electric Co with a 100 MW PWR in Massachusetts
- Consumer Public Power of Nebraska with a 75 MW sodium-graphite reactor

Strauss expected a fifth proposal for a fluid-fuel rector but it never arrived.

# Atoms for Peace

211 This chapter covers the beginnings of the IAEA and lots of political maneuvering
with the Soviet Union related to fissionable material, commercial nuclear, research
reactors, and weapons testing. Within the administration, there was some foot
dragging:

{:.blockquote}

> Strauss said he did not oppose the President's proposal; he merely wished to warn
> that Atoms for Peace would not soon take precedence over Atoms for War.

221 The Russians criticized the Atoms for Peace proposals, calling, suggesting that
the peaceful atom was an illusion and that growing electrical generation with nuclear
reactors would increase the amount of nuclear materials available for weapons. The
Americans assured the world that safeguards could be developed to prevent the spread
of weapons from peaceful operations.

# Pursuit of the Peaceful Atom

244 Eisenhower got really excited about a nuclear-powered merchant ship in 1955.
Rickover basically killed it at the time by saying it would delay the naval needs.

245 Nelson Rockefeller was infatuated with small power reactors as the basis of an
Atomic Marshall Plan for the world. He pushed to build more research reactors around
the world and declassify reactor information. He wanted the US to help India, Japan,
Brazil, and Italy with power reactors immediately. The AEC and State Dept were not
excited about it. They dragged their feet and effectively killed the enthusiasm.

252 First Commercial nuclear regulations were drafted in 1956, attempting but
uncertain if they struck the right balance between protecting the public and giving
companies the freedom needed to commercialize the technology.

253 The Brookhaven lab was the closest to reaching the original ideal of regional
academic center with partnerships with nearby universities.

257 The technology of [strong
focusing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_focusing) enabled much higher-power
particle accelerators.

258 Discussion of what I assume led to Fermilab. Apparently Walter Zinn at Argonne
got really dramatic and resigned because the plan didn't include the Argonne lab
enough in high-energy physics.

261 Discussion of fusion power

263 The AEC spent lots of money on cancer treatment research and biological work.
Tracer studies with radioisotopes furthered understandings of biological systems and
effectiveness of drugs extremely well.

Along the way, studies on the biological effects of radiation were broadened. The AEC
focused some studies on fallout, including when radioisotopes are uptaken into organ
systems.

265 Project Gabriel studied short and long term effects of fallout to understand the
implications of a nuclear attack.

266-268 The Muller Fiasco is described. [Hermann
Muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Joseph_Muller) had won a Nobel Prize in 1946
for his work on the effects of radiation on genetics. He was scheduled to present a
paper at the Peaceful Uses conference in Geneva, 1955 on the topic. He had give a
lecture at the National Academy of Sciences called "The Genetic Damage Produced by
Radiation", and gave a copy to the _Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists_. The paper was
moderate and judicious. He criticised both those who discount any genetic damage from blast
victims of Japan, and also those who loudly claimed that weapons tests are
undermining the genetic basis for all mankind. He urged efforts to minimize fallout,
but unequivocally supported testing them for national security reasons. The paper was
submitted for Geneva, promptly accepted by the American scientists, and scheduled.
But then Muller's invitation was revoked ostensibly because he had been an active
socialist during his youth in the Great Depression in NYC. This caused an outcry of
protests from the American scientists. The AEC's credibility was damaged yet again, as it
appeared to be suppressing discussion of genetic effects of weapons testing.

269 The [Dixon-Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixon-Yates_contract) issue is
mentioned for the umpteenth time. This is likely one of the main issues that
politicized nuclear power across party lines in the USA. It's basically about
government-funded vs privately-funded power plants

# The Seeds of Anxiety

277 Churchill, after learning about how bad nuclear weapons had gotten, abandoned
expensive air raid shelter work since they would not help in thermonuclear war.

280 Foster thought that thermonuclear realities would eventually require a radical
change in the way we design cities. We'd have to eliminate densely populated
metropolitan areas altogether.

286 Eisenhower wanted to enlist the best advertising man in the country to find out
how to best discuss the issues of fallout with the country. The CEO of Coca Cola was
consulted, but upon hearing about it, recommended not talking to Americans about it
at all! Hilarious.

287 AEC report on fallout was painted by Lapp as a hesitant response to his crusade
for more info from the _Bulletin_. Lapp characterised radiation as a mystical
invisible killer.

288 Congress and Lapp didn't know that the State and Defense Depts had been holding
up the AEC's fallout report for so long. This just continued to erode public trust.

290 The public blamed unseasonable snow on the Operation Teapot tests, and the
fallout was detected all around the country

291 The Soviet Union participated heavily in spreading fear of fallout and radiation
in general in order to slow down US progress in weapons design. They were behind and
needed the US to delay so they could catch up.

293 Apparently antibiotics can cause genetic mutations too.

296 These authors are great:

{:.blockquote}

> But as in tempering steel, the more the commission threw cold water on the
> linkage the harder it became.

304 Pope Pius called for an end of nuclear testing, embarrassing the AEC because they
couldn't claim he was politically or ideologically motivated.

307 A moral imperative to find redeeming value in the engineering successes of
nuclear weapons drove Eisenhower to obsess over progress in Atoms for Peace.

312 It was thought that proper safeguards and inspections in a reprocessed system
with fluids might be actually impossible.

316 A task force conceded that any large dedicated country could make a nuclear
arsenal if they wanted to. Russians continued to say Atoms for Peace could spread
nuclear weapons skills to underdeveloped small countries as well.

332 Dulles feared that the nuclear paradigm would decrease the value of being an
American ally.

341 Linear No Threshold dose response model agreed upon by most geneticists in 1956.

343 As much as Democrats like public power, the drive of [Al Gore
Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore_Sr) was to make power reactors to compete
with the Soviets.

344 Debate on the Gore-Holifield bill sounds interesting. The AEC and Administration
and private industry fought the Democrats desire to have the AEC build power reactors
on AEC sites to power the AEC sites. The bill was defeated in the House and killed
the chances for a nuclear power bill in the 84th Congress. Democrats had dreamed of a
national energy policy but now the dream was in shambles.
[Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Presba_Anderson) became even more
suspicious of Strauss' motives, and began suspecting that he was opposed to nuclear
power because it would threaten the economic interests of his friends in the fossil
industry, the Rockefellers.

345 More understanding of fallout to the public after the _Redwing_ test series where
we tested our first airdrops of multimegaton thermonuclear bombs. The Army chief of
R&D confirmed that a recent _Fortune_ article was correct in that a large attack
would kill 7 million Americans and render hundreds of square miles uninhabitable for
perhaps a generation (largely from Sr-90). Worse:

{:.blockquote}

> Gavin predicted that American retaliation against Russia
> would spread death from radiation across Asia to Japan and the Philippines. Or if
> the winds blew the other way, an attack on eastern Russia could eventually kill
> hundreds or millions of Europeans including, some commentators added, possibly half the
> population of the British Isles.

This classified testimony was released on June 28, 1956, further informing the
startled public of the implications of nuclear warfare. The President's advisers and
the AEC started promoting the development and testing of "clean" nuclear bombs, which
could be designed to have much less fallout.

347 Strauss' talk of clean nuclear weapons exposed the AEC to scathing criticism from
the press.

# Nuclear Issues: The Presidential Campaign of 1956

351 The 1956 election campaign vs. Stevenson was the first election where nuclear
issues were prominently featured. Eisenhower easily won, but the AEC, its leadership,
and its programs payed a political price and lost more public confidence.

353 The EBR-1 core meltdown raise safety concerns regarding the Fermi 1 fast reactor
project near Detroit. The ACRS warned the general manager that more study of the
Idaho accident was needed before Fermi 1 should proceed. The AEC worried that delay
in Fermi would undercut progress in power demonstration. Political fights between the
AEC and the Joint Committee lead Anderson to tell the governor of Michigan of the
situation, but the AEC still didn't want to release the report. Anderson was so angry
that he suggested that the new Congress should consider legislation that would
separate the AEC's licensing and regulatory functions from its research and
production responsibilities. This foreshadows the eventual split of the AEC into the
NRC and the DOE.

359 The [Piqua organic-cooled reactor in
Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piqua_Nuclear_Generating_Station) and the
[Consumers Hallam sodium-graphite project in
Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallam_Nuclear_Generating_Station) were
approved, partially to blunt the charge by the rural cooperatives that the AEC was
favoring big private utilities.

  <figure>
  <img src="/img/hallam.jpg" alt="Hallam Reactor" class="img img-fluid center-block" >
<figcaption>The Hallam sodium-graphite reactor only operated for like a year</figcaption>
  </figure>

The AEC at this time was worried that once the government funded some nuclear
development costs, private industry would expect it to fund all future development
costs too.

{:.blockquote}

> Strauss immediately voiced his concern that, once the Commission opened the door,
> there would be no way to close it.

The AEC agreed that winning the international race in reactor development was more
important that keeping the government out of nuclear power.

Looking back, there's some truth to this; private industry for a long time expected
the government to pay the big bucks for nuclear developments. Private startups today
almost ubiquitously depend on large government development programs.

365 In the campaign, Eisenhower said he would not endorse any "theatrical national
gesture" to end weapons testing without reliable inspection, and said this great
line:

{:.blockquote}

> We cannot salute the future with bold words while we surrender it with feeble
> deeds.

366 In response to Eisenhower trying to be final, Stevenson said that there can be no
last word in the hydrogen bomb until mankind had been freed from the menace of
nuclear incineration.

367 Stevenson had a way of describing the power of nuclear bombs.

{:.blockquote}

> He noted the power of a 20 MT bomb --- as "if every man, woman, and child on earth
> were each carrying a 16 pound bundle of dynamite --- enough to blow him to
> smithereens, and then some."

He also described strontium-90 as the most dreadful poison in the world. He wanted to
stop the tests before a maniac like Hitler or other irresponsible regimes fouled the
atmosphere with tests of their own.

369 The AEC wanted to help disabuse the public of Stevenson's inaccurate campaign
statements about the biological effects of radiation. They agreed to use their
speaking engagements to present correct technical information.

# In Search of a Nuclear Test Ban

373 Soviet Premier Bulganin wrote a political letter to Eisenhower to interfere with
the American election. Some things never change.

379 Senator Neuberger proposed an independent institute responsible for studying
nuclear health. The AEC opposed this, suggesting it would duplicate facilities.
Clearly, military atmospheric testing was damaging world opinion.

390 Albert Schweitzer, a famous doctor/musician/philosopher came over Radio Norway to
advocate the banning of nuclear weapons tests. Professors joined in. Linus Pauling
said so during an address to Washington University. Lots of Nobel Laureates. They
said we shouldn't devastate the beautiful world in which we live.

395 Stassen, trying to negotiate with the USSR all the time, was a total cowboy and
did stuff against the administration's will. He probably had political motivations.

397 It was feared that as bombs became smaller and cheaper, places like France would
see less value in NATO and the American Atomic Shield.

399 The weaponeers, Teller and Lawrence, had moral justifications for additional
atmospheric testing. They said we knew how to make dirty bombs of unlimited size,
and if war came, we'd have to use them (God forbid). But if we keep testing (at
minimal risk), we can make better bombs that can be limited to military targets
without destroying the planet. Clean bombs offer big military and psychological
advantages.

At this point, plutonium was considered far superior to highly-enriched uranium for
weapons.

400 Teller warned senators of ways to muffle subterranean megaton blasts and upper
atmosphere testing during a test ban. If the Russians developed clean bombs first,
he said, we'd be in real dire straits.

Lilienthal was disgusted at the mega-bomb proponents marching to D.C. saying what
Oppenheimer had said before: we need small tactical bombs.

# Politics of the Peaceful Atom

404 [The Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_crisis) in Fall 1956 and the
Hungarian revolution got the EURATOM negotiations back into high gear, emphasizing
the need to develop nuclear energy as rapidly as an alternative to Middle Eastern
oil. A committee of three was appointed to formulate a politically and technically
feasible nuclear power program to meet this need. The _Three Wise Men_ were Louis
Armand of France, Franz Etzel of Germany, and Francesco Giodani of Italy. At this
time, Europeans agreed that the French could develop nuclear weapons if they'd share
access to weapon research and development and the weapon stockpile.

406 Europe was facing the import of 100 million tons of coal annually, increasing to
300 million by 1975. They would be able to pay 9-12 mills/kWh, which was higher than
the Americans. The AEC thought American reactors might find a market in Europe for
this reason.

American efforts in the power demonstration program had proven that the private
industry in the USA could not finance the development of commercial nuclear power.

{:.blockquote}

> ... industry had badly underestimated the difficulties involved in designing and
> building nuclear power plants.

Inflation and rising cost estimates were dampening industry interest in nuclear
power. The Shippingport unit under construction had escalated to be 5-10x the costs
for fossil-fueled plants. Meanwhile the UK's gas reactor program was focused.

{:.blockquote}

> Shippingport was hardly an attractive selling point for American technology.

410 Still angry about the defeat of Gore-Holifield, democratic senator Anderson held
up the insurance indemnity bill, which nuclear manufacturers demanded, until the AEC
became more cooperative. Through political maneuvering, the first, second, and a new
third round of the Power Demonstration Reactor Program was approved, a Plutonium
recycling experimental reactor at Hanford, and studies of a natural-uranium,
graphite-moderated, gas-cooled power reactor were authorized.

The [Price-Anderson
Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93Anderson_Nuclear_Industries_Indemnity_Act)
was then introduced and quickly passed. It requires operators of large power reactors
to carry the maximum amount of insurance available from private companies and
indemnifies them for $500M over the private coverage. At the same time, the ACRS
was transformed into a statutory body and its reports were made public.

Morale was low for the nuclear industry in 1957. The Five-Year Plan reactor had
twelve government projects now, but of the 5 reactors that operated, 2 had serious
design flaws, 2 were just starting up, and the fifth was a test device. None had
suggested a promising new approach to nuclear power. The Power Demonstration Reactor
Program wasn't doing much better. Several private companies were operating privately
funded reactors at this time as well.

413 Walter Zinn told Strauss that he was convinced that the US's concentration on
water-cooled reactors with enriched fuel was a mistake. He favored natural-uranium
reactors using a liquid coolant like sodium. He was frustrated that the AEC waited
for industry to decide on reactor designs rather than guiding the direction.

The [Elk River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_River_Station) estimates soon
exceeded the allowed ceiling. Foster Wheeler Corp backed out of the Wolverine fluid
fuel project. Confusion broke out in the industry. The AEC convened a reactor
advisory group in October '57 to discuss the economic potential of nuclear reactors.

414 The advisory committee said that capital costs in water-cooled plants can only be
reduced by increasing the power. They determined that a long campaign of patient and
painstaking development was the likely pathway to nuclear power, not dramatic
technical breakthroughs. Even then, capturing economies of scale was likely the only
credible path forward. There was too much breadth and not enough depth in the current
reactor programs.

Davis presented these findings at the Atomic Industrial Forum in NYC, saying new
reactors would be the most economical in the long run, but that early economics would
be found in very large installations of water-cooled reactors.

418 By December 1957, a series of industry conferences said otherwise. Utility executives
did not et know enough about the various types of reactors to commit themselves to
one concept. They wanted orderly R&D into alternatives to water reactors rather than
rushing into investments in large reactors that would produce very expensive power.
This disagreement caused some fracture in the industry as a whole.

421 Rickover ended up getting Shippingport up and running on December 2 1957 (15
years to the day after the first chain reaction at CP-1). The utilities hated him. He
was egotistical and demanded grueling shift work. But he got stuff done. In the end,
it cost 64 mills/kW, compared to 6 mills/kW for a comparable fossil plant.

422 Thousands of engineering documents from Shippingport are publicly available.

423 The Navy went all in on nuclear submarines, and Rickover set out to deliver. He
trained the suppliers to accept the rigid requirements as both attainable and
necessary. He put in place quality assurance programs at suppliers. He realized
economies of mass production. While the commissioners debated policy, Rickover built
a network of companies upon which the nuclear industry would depend.

424 More discussion of dual-purpose reactors?!

429 Strauss' principles of keeping government out prevented the AEC from putting
together a comprehensive strategy and left the AEC weak.

# Euratom and the International Agency, 1957-1958

433 Conservative David Teeple led drive against the IAEA, calling it the "President's
fantastic Atomic Energy giveaway plan"

440 With Sputnik launching in 1957, some wanted to use atomic energy as an
international bellwether of american scientific preeminence.

# Toward a Nuclear Test Moratorium

451 More talk of Russians spreading fear of radiation to help them catch up in
nuclear weaponry.

452 In 1957, Shute published [On the
Beach](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(novel)>), an apocalyptic novel
about the world laid to waste by radioactive fallout. This was turned into a few
movies. A nuclear submarine captain and crew survived and are in Australia. Everyone
knows they have only a few months to live before the radiation comes down to them.
They go to Seattle but it's a barren wasteland. Everyone commits suicide in the end.
I need to watch/read this.

483 A Quaker group set up camp near Nevada Test Site to protest. They got arrested.
Pacifists organized into SANE, and lobbied for a test ban. They planned to sail the
_Golden Rule_ to the Pacific Proving Grounds to stop the _Hardtack_ test series. They
got about a mile from Honolulu before getting detained by the Coast Guard. It
captured public and press attention.

484-485 A group came to the lobby of the AEC headquarters and said they would fast there
until they could speak with the Commissioners. The AEC said they could stay there
indefinitely and provided cots, blankets, a telephone, and a washroom. Sandwiches,
coffees, soda were offered, and everyone was friendly. They waited a week. One
commissioner volunteered to talk to them, but this wasn't good enough for the
protestors. They wanted to see Strauss. Strauss agreed, and the unusual meeting
occurred. The protestors appealed to Christian-Judaic tradition and to Ghandi. It was
on high moral ground. Strauss was moved, and remarked how in WWII he refused on moral
grounds to invest in munitions or distilleries. But the holocaust convinced him that
only America's great nuclear deterrent had saved the world from communist domination.
The group disagreed and said the US should not have fought the Nazis. Strauss (a Jew)
asked if the Civil War was justified. The pacifists said "No. The body is nothing.
Only the freedom of the spirit mattered". The dialog ended here. The demonstrators
ended up in front of the White House.

Strauss had already resigned at this point, and McCone took over.

488 Edward Teller explained that underground testing would not hamper the weapons
program at all. This may allow the US to unilaterally ban atmospheric testing.

# A New Approach to Nuclear Power

492 McCone said dual-purpose (commercial + weapons) reactors were unacceptable.

494 McCone worried that GE and Westinghouse were not as rigorous on their commercial
projects as they were in the naval projects.

495 Zinn and Smyth published a national nuclear power policy in August 1958

Panel wanted commission to take on positive direction and stop asking private
industry to say which types of reactors they liked best.

497 Rickover thought the quest for economic central station power would threaten
public safety.

504 McCone wanted the kind of solid data that engineers and businessmen needed to
make sound decisions about nuclear power. He canceled the Alaska SFR at Churgach but
continued the Hallam Nebraska one even though it wouldn't produce good engineering
data.

505 McCone was not excited about the Joint Committee's request for gas-cooled
reactors because they were too different from what we new. He was also not excited
about fluid fuel reactors for similar reasons.

506 The [Merchant Nuclear ship NS
Savannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah) originally was supposed to have
a clone of the _Nautilus_ core but Rickover said this was not appropriate. B&W did a
new design. They didn't ask the Navy for any experience info. McCone asked the Navy
to review the design. Press thought Rickover was trying to take over, but he wasn't.
Rickover listed the ways it was different from a Naval system but didn't find any
major design flaws.

508 More talk and references about evaluating the promise and future of nuclear
reactors.

509 Coal prices fell in Europe, tempering the earlier demand for nuclear.

Breeder reactors were expected to be needed in 50 years. Therefore, they were not a
high priority.

511 An industrial process heat experiment with a PWR in California was planned. I wonder what
happened with that.

# Science for War and Peace

516 [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1) got science advisors on the
highest government positions they've ever had before or since.

517 Aircraft reactor interest revived after sputnik but wasn't looking promising.
Many recommended cutting the budget.

518 Mention of Kennedy killing the [Nuclear
Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion). This is what
Weinberg said as well.

519 Science advisors didn't like the lab's projects
[Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto) and Rover for nuclear rockets
and missiles and ramjets, especially considering the progress in conventional jets.

[SNAP series RTGs and small
reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power) were
very cheap and very successful. Helped by Sputnik as well, of course.

520 Brief mention of the [Army Nuclear Power
Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Nuclear_Power_Program). Small and cheap.
They didn't command the attention of McCone, York, Kistiakowsky, or the president.
ML-1 barely mentioned, Plus a small BWR? What's that?

521 Nuclear navy went on crazy adventures to the north pole and whatnot, like Jules
Verne-level adventures. The Triton circumnavigated the earth without surfacing
([Operation Sandblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sandblast)).

526 Politics and money cannot always drive technology (regarding fusion power)

529 Some talk of [Project Plowshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Plowshare)
and peaceful nuclear explosions

532 Rickover went to Russia to ride on the [Lenin
icebreaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_icebreaker_Lenin) with VP Nixon. He
lost his security detail and talked to people at will. What a character.

536 Stuff about Russia cooperation. We agreed to study nuclear waste disposal with
them.
