1. It is simple.
2. It is small.
3. It is cheap.
4. It is light.
5. It can be built very quickly.
6. It is very flexible in purpose ("omnibus reactor")
7. Very little development is required. It will use mostly "off-the-shelf" components.
8. The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.

<p class="text-decoration-underline fs-4">Practical reactor</p>

1. It is being built now.
2. It is behind schedule.
3. It is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items.
   Corrosion, in particular, is a problem.
4. It is very expensive.
5. It takes a long time to build because of the engineering development problems.
6. It is large.
7. It is heavy.
8. It is complicated.
