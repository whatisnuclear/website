Nuclear-powered engines have propelled submarines, aircraft carriers, destroyers, merchant
shipping vessels, and icebreakers. Nuclear energy is interesting at sea because:

- It's very energy-dense, so a ship could be underway at high power for decades without
  refueling.
- It does not emit carbon dioxide and therefore allows shipping without climate change
- It doesn't require oxygen for combustion, so submarines don't need to surface frequently, and
  the engine and sailors don't compete for air.

## Submarines

When nuclear energy was first harnessed, the US Navy became extremely
interested in using it to power its fleet of submarines.
A nuclear-powered submarine has a critical nuclear chain reaction going
on near the center of the submarine. This boils water, which then
goes through a turbine. The turbine is hooked up to a big drive-shaft
that is hooked to a propeller on the back of the submarine. There are
auxiliary turbines as well that are hooked up to electric generators
to make electricity for the systems on the sub.

There are two main types of nuclear-powered submarines:

### Ballistic missile submarines

Ballistic missile subs (AKA "boomers") are not only
powered by a nuclear reactor, but they also carry a large amount 
of missiles with thermonuclear weapons for warheads. These submarines
are supposed to just prowl around in unknown locations in the sea as a 
deterrent, so if someone nukes you, you can nuke them back from these subs
and they'll never be able to prevent you from doing so because you could
be anywhere. In essence, these prevent people from nuking other people.

### Fast attack submarines

Fast attack subs are the hunter-killers of the sea. 
Their job is to hunt down and destroy other submarines or vessels. 
They're fast and typically armed with things like Tomahawk missiles,
and MK-48 torpedoes.

## Nuclear-powered surface ships

Nuclear propulsion worked so well for submarines that a few other
vessels got nuclear engines instead of conventional
diesels. Most notably, vessels like the _Gerald R. Ford_-class
aircraft carriers have a few nuclear reactors powering them.
The US Navy has had nuclear-powered cruisers as well, but
does not have any now.

## Civilian nuclear propulsion

Running merchant ships with nuclear-powered engines is a good way to decarbonize
the world's shipping infrastructure. In the early days of the nuclear industry, this
received a large amount of attention, culminating in the creation and operation of the NS
Savannah.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Did you know?** The [NS Savannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah)
was a nuclear-powered cargo ship that operated between 1962 and 1972. It's
deactivated now and moored at Pier 13 in Baltimore.  [We got a whole documentary
about Savannah scanned.]({% link _news/2023-07-12-the-nuclear-ship-savannah-film-digitized.md %})

Some good information on nuclear marine propulsion may be found in:

- Kramer's 624-page book [Nuclear Propulsion for Merchant
  Ships](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104123911&view=1up&seq=7) from
  1962 is a trove.
- [This 240-page 1958
  report](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822031448046&view=1up&seq=9) covers
  a wide variety of options in this space
- [P. Garay wrote a whole article on nuclear-powered tugs in
  '63](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-3584.1963.tb04392.x)
- [Gravina et al wrote this
  report](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/351357/1/CONCEPTS%2520FOR%2520A%2520MODULAR%2520NUCLEAR%2520POWERED%2520CONTAINERSHIP.pdf)
  on the topic (which btw has a fruitful reference section itself)

Today, Russia operates a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers. A few nuclear merchant ships
operated but only one is in commission today (the
[Sevmorput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevmorput)). They would be an excellent way to
reduce the emissions from the huge amount of international shipping that's ongoing today.

## Nuclear airplanes and rockets

<a href="/img/HTRE-3.jpg"><img src="/img/HTRE-3-sm.jpg" alt="The HTRE-3 test reactor hooked to jets for airplanes" class="img img-responive float-end" style="width:350px;padding:15px;"/></a>
Nuclear propulsion is well-suited for [space travel]({% link space.md %}) and rockets, so that's
under development. The Russians did have some nuclear-powered tanks.
Before intercontinnental ballistic missiles were developed, the US Air
Force worked a lot on the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project to make
a nuclear-powered long-range airplane. Various test reactors like HTRE-3
pictured here were operated
in this project but no plane ever actually flew, so far, on nuclear power.

The only nuclear-powered cars you're likely to ever see are electric ones
charged by nearby nuclear power plants.
