title="Thor by Marten Eskil Winge. Thor is a mythical Norse god associated with
thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind,
healing, and fertility.  Thorium was so named in the 1820s, well before its
nuclear properties were discovered in 1942. Coincidence?" src="img/Thor.jpg"/>
**Dear Internet,** we need to have a talk about Thorium. Almost all the
borderline-miraculous things people say it does online are associated with
advanced nuclear technology (e.g. [breeding]({% link recycling.md %}) and
low-pressure coolant systems) and apply to both thorium and uranium fuels.
Generally, you can swap the word "thorium" out for "advanced nuclear".

## Motivation

The things being said on the internet have become largely misleading, if not
all-out inaccurate. Every internet person I meet in real life who finds out that
I am a nuclear engineer asks me why we aren't using the end-all, be-all that is
thorium. Every post regarding nuclear energy is packed full of comments claiming
that Thorium will end all concerns about nuclear energy and that Uranium is only
in use due to some dark dark conspiracy.

Some places on the internet have become echo-chambers for this kind of thing,
and while it's great to spread awareness of thorium, blatant disregard of the
associated challenges is a detriment to civilization's energy debate. Besides,
taking a moderate viewpoint lends credibility to any cause. This page will try
to point people in the right direction if they get lost.

Thorium has one primary advantage, which is that it **uniquely allows
[breeding]({% link recycling.md %}) with [slow neutrons]({% link moderation.md
%})**. Breeding is possible with [fast neutrons]({% link fast-reactor.md %}) in
any fuel, but doing it with slow neutrons is kind of neat. Everything else you
may have heard is suspect.

<h2 id="myth1">Myth #1: Development of Thorium reactors was stopped because they couldn't make bombs!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span>
Nope. It was economics. When you add a neutron poison like thorium into your core, you
need to add extra enriched uranium, which is extra expensive. Simple as that.

Thorium fuel was included alongside uranium in the first core of the Indian Point 1
reactor in New York in the early 1960s. The second core had no thorium. Here's an exchange
from 1963:

For the molten-salt variety of thorium reactors, a lucid description of what happened can
be found on page 49 of WASH-1222 [1]. There, they describe a few privately-funded working
group studies of the MSBR, including the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor Associates
(consisting of the engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch and five midwestern utilities) and
the Molten Salt Group, headed by Ebasco Services, Inc. (with 5 other industrial firms and
fifteen utilities involved). These groups concluded that the MSBR (basically the LFTR) is
attractive and potentially cheaper than LWRs. They said that a demonstration plant is
warranted, but the performance cannot be predicted with confidence. Then, a list of
factors that limit industrial involvement is given. They include (verbatim):

- The existing major industrial and utility commitments to the LWR, HTGR, and LMFBR.
- The lack of incentive for industrial investment in supplying fuel cycle services, such as those
  required for solid fuel reactors.
- The overwhelming manufacturing and operating experience with solid fuel reactors in contrast with
  the very limited involvement with fluid fueled reactors.
- The less advanced state of MSBR technology and the lack of demonstrated solutions to the major
  technical problems associated with the MSBR concept.

Weapons were produced with graphite or heavy-water moderated production reactors and with
gas centrifuge enrichment. Also, thermonuclear weapons require tritium, which is something
that many Thorium MSR designs excel in producing because they often contain Lithium. The
commercial LWRs had nothing to do with making bomb material. Stop the nonsense.

To be fair, you can rightly argue that U-Pu-fueled reactors got developed in the first place (in the
Manhattan project of the 1940s) for weapons reasons. Back then (before enrichment), Th-fueled
reactors couldn't even go critical, much less make bombs. Natural uranium reactors were the
only way to go. This gave them the technical head start that has arguably led to their dominance.
However, when MSRs were finally given their chance in the 1950s and 60s, their (non-existent)
inability to make bombs was not to blame for the cancellation.

<h2 id="myth15">Myth #1.5: One tonne of Thorium contains as much energy as 200 tonnes of Uranium!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span>
What's happening is that people are comparing thorium used in a [breeder
reactor]({% link recycling.md %}) vs. uranium used in a non-breeder reactor.
It's true that breeder reactors can get ~200x more energy out of any nuclear
fuel, but this has nothing to do with uranium vs. thorium. It's just breeder
reactors vs. non-breeders.

In fact, uranium-238 contains about [1% more energy than Thorium-232 per
mass]({% link energy-density.md %}).

<h2 id="myth2">Myth #2: Thorium reactors never need enrichment!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span>
Like all reactors, Thorium reactors need some fissile material to start up. Thorium itself
is a neutron poison and needs to be irradiated by neutrons (coming from somewhere) in
order to start making good nuclear fuel.

Once started up, **any** [breeder reactor]({% link recycling.md %}) (using uranium and/or
thorium) can be fissile self-sufficient, meaning they breed more (or equal) fissile
material than they consume.

It should be noted, however, that the key advantage of Th fuel is that it allows breeding
with slow neutrons. This means that you can start up a Th-based breeder with
substantially (between 3 and 10 times) less fissile material than you need to start an
equivalent-powered fast breeder reactor. Once started, the fast breeder will make far more
fissile material (because they make have a better breeding neutron economy), but the
amount of fissile in fast spectrum reactors is always more than in slow-neutron reactors.

TL;DR: They do to start up, and U-Pu breeders like the LMFBR can do the same so it's not Thorium specific.

<h2 id="myth3">Myth #3: Thorium reactors cannot make bombs!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span>

Nuclear reactors, by their nature, split atoms in a chain reaction to release energy
slowly, safely, and under control. If a nefarious operator controls such a system, they
can use various means to extract the fissile nuclear fuel atoms and concentrate them into
a weapon. Thus, all reactors require safeguards and inspections from the UN nuclear
watchdog, the IAEA. This includes Thorium reactors.

Thorium reactors work by breeding Th-232 through Protactinium-233
(27.4 day half life) and into Uranium-233, which is fissile. Pa-233 is a pretty strong neutron
absorber, so the MSBR (basically the LFTR) has to extract it from the core once it is produced and
let it decay to U-233 away from the neutrons. Once the U-233 is created, it gets fed back into the
reactor. Well, if you went rogue, you could build up a little excess reactivity (maybe add some
low-enriched U-235?) and then divert the freshly-bred U-233 into a weapons stream to make U-233
nuclear bombs. It may be difficult to do this several times without going subcritical, but it
certainly could be done. A U-233-filled bomb has been tested before, and it worked just fine.

But don't take my word for it. Here is [a declassified
letter](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/79078) entitled _LRL interest in U-233_ from the
USA's top nuclear weapons design team from 1966. It says:

<p><img class="img img-fluid" src="/img/livermore_u233.jpg" alt="Letter from Livermore lab about how good U-233 is as a weapons
material" title="The letter text"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> The text of the Livermore weapons scientists saying U-233 is only
<em>better than plutonium</em> in some rare scenarios, so they don't need to ditch plutonium and
switch everything over to U-233 (emphasis mine)</p>

More information about the specifics of making clean U-233 can be found in this 1965
article by Woods entitled [Clean
Uranium-233](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/4602161-clean-uranium), and in this (more readily
available) article: [Boswell, Production of U-233 with Low U-232 Content
(1968)](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015003994939&view=1up&seq=763).

Here's a quote from a Frank von Hippel paper on the subject [2]:

<blockquote style="margin: 1em 3em;
font-size: small;
padding: .5em 1em;
border-left: 5px solid #fce27c;
background-color: #f6ebc1; "><p>&quot;On the one hand, gamma radiation from U-232 makes the U-233 from high-
burnup U-233-thorium fuel cycles more of a radiation hazard than plutonium.
On the other hand, because of its low rate of spontaneous-neutron emission,
U-233 can, unlike plutonium, be used in simple gun-type fission-weapon
designs without significant danger of the yield being reduced by premature
initiation of the fission chain reaction&quot;</p></blockquote>

And another (also [2]):

<blockquote style="margin: 1em 3em;
font-size: small;
padding: .5em 1em;
border-left: 5px solid #fce27c;
background-color: #f6ebc1; "><p>&quot;In the case of the molten-salt
U-233 breeder reactor, it was proposed to have continual chemical processing
of a stream of liquid fuel. Such an arrangement also offers a way to completely bypass the U-232
contamination problem because 27-day half-life Pa-
233 could be separated out before it decays into U-233.&quot;</p></blockquote>

Options to make bomb-making less favorable include fostering substantial U-232 contamination in the
reactor and denaturing the U-233 with U-238 that keeps the in-reactor inventory safe. Both of these
options can conceptually be bypassed in the Pa separation route though. Besides, U-232 isn't
releasing the gammas, its decay products are, and it has a **70 year** half-life. So you can just
chemically purify your stolen goods and then make the bomb anytime within the next few months or so.

</p>

There are about a dozen other ways people try to amp up the proliferation resistance of various
fuel cycles. But they always forget that the owner of such a plant can secretly install a chemical
cell that does Pa separation.

Really, most civilian power to bombs proliferation paths are mythical,
in any reactor, because they're so difficult! But since the consequences of proliferation
are so dire, nuclear power plants need to have baseline proliferation safeguards in place.
Thorium-powered reactors, whether fluid fueled or not, are no exception.

<h2 id="myth4">Myth #4: There's more Thorium than Uranium, and that is really important!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-warning">MISLEADING</button></span> 
This one is mostly true, but also partially false. The average crustal concentration of Thorium is
0.00060%, compared with 0.00018% for Uranium [3]. But, the oceanic abundance of Th is
4x10<sup>-12</sup>%, compared with 3.3x10<sup>-7</sup>% (mass percent). Considering that the oceans
contain 1.4x10<sup>21</sup> kg of water, that amounts to 56,000 tonnes of Th and 4.62 billion tonnes
of Uranium. Moreover, mining the entire crust is difficult, whereas the ocean delivers to you. While
seawater extraction of uranium is not yet competitive with traditional mining (it&rsquo;s hovering
around 4x more expensive), it is possible and may become economical in the near future. So while
Myth 4 is correct with respect to the crust, it&rsquo;s not necessarily relevant from a
global resource perspective, and there may very well be more accessible Uranium available to us. The
crust is estimated to weigh around 1.0x10<sup>22</sup> kg, so overall, there is actually more Th.
If you want to get very technical and start including asteroid and star mining, the abundance of Th
in the universe is estimated at about 2x that of Uranium.

If you&rsquo;re the Indian government, however, you&rsquo;ll note that you have hundreds of
thousands of tonnes of Th but basically zero U. So you guys might want some Th-power to secure a
domestic supply! China has about an estimated 50% more known U than Th [4,5].

Another point, if you look at the known reserves of economically extractable Thorium vs. Uranium
[4,5], you&rsquo;ll find that they are both nearly identical (though many people argue that we can
economically extract Th from lots of common sands). And remember, if we close the fuel cycle
(whether using Th-U or U-Pu), the fuel resources are a non-issue for millennia.

<h2 id="myth5">Myth #5: Thorium reactors uniquely make waste that is safe in hundreds of years!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span> 
Undenatured Thorium cycles certainly produce fewer transuranic elements (Np, Pu, Am, Cm,+), which
are the major dangerous nuclides in <a href="{% link waste.md %}">nuclear waste</a> in the 10,000+
year timeframe. In fact, the long-term decay heat from Thorium-MSRs can be orders of magnitude lower
than that from traditional reactors. However, this same capability exists in many other reactor
concepts, including U-Pu fueled <a href="{% link fast-reactor.md %}">fast reactors</a> with
reprocessing. So, if someone says that MSR/LFTR waste is better than traditional LWR waste, they are
correct. If they say Thorium is the only game in town that can reduce waste like this, then they are
not correct.

<h2 id="myth6">Myth #6: Thorium reactors and Molten Salt Reactors are the same thing!</h2>
<span class="float-end"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">NOT ALWAYS</button></span> 
On one hand you can choose between a Th-U fuel cycle and a U-Pu fuel cycle. On the other hand, you
can choose between a fluid fueled reactor (like a [MSR]({% link msr.md %})) or a solid fueled reactor (like a LWR or a
sodium-cooled fast reactor). Now, the Th-U cycle works really really well with MSRs, and
that&rsquo;s why they are often discussed together. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this, but
it&rsquo;s nice to know what benefits come from which choice. The Th-U fuel cycle can be (and has
been) used in solid fueled reactors and the U-Pu fuel cycle can be (and has been) used in MSRs.

The attributes of a system that come from choosing a fluid fueled reactor include: the ability to
have passive safety by draining the fuel into cooled storage tanks, online fission product removal,
low/zero fabrication cost, low fissile requirement, low excess reactivity (since you refuel online)
[6]

The attributes that come from choosing the Th-U fuel cycle over the U-Pu cycle include:
the possibility of slow-neutron (thermal) breeding (as demonstrated in the Shippingport
LWR), the reduced production of minor actinides (see Myth #5), allowing nuclear
waste to be safer without aggressive reprocessing, and the ability to use the Thorium
mineral base instead of the Uranium minerals (useful if your country has Th but no U. See
Myth #4).

Thorium is absolutely a viable and capable fuel, and some advanced nuclear reactors that

<h1 id="wall">The Wall of Shame</h1>

This section shows a few examples of articles that propagate the misinformation
represented by the myths. Oftentimes, people ask us how on Earth they were able to read
so much that was so wrong. The simple reason is that there is a lot of stuff out there
that repeats the myths. We hope journalists will go the extra mile before publishing
more of this.

- [Sam O'Nella academy -- Why Thorium Rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjM9E6d42-M)
  --- A very popular Youtube video that gets it so wrong that I just can't even. It's like
  no one ever told them that they're describing breeding and thinking that thorium is
  somehow the only way to breed. Of course this is not true. Uranium can breed too. The
  entire video is misleading.

- [Richard Martin, "Uranium Is So Last Century — Enter Thorium, the New Green
  Nuke"](https://www.wired.com/2009/12/ff_new_nukes/) An article about the primary Thorium
  proponent, Kirk Sorensen. Hits every single myth, and is accidentally misleading
  on many accounts.

- [Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry,"This energy source could solve all of our problems — so why is
  no one talking about
  it?"](https://theweek.com/articles/450000/energy-source-could-solve-all-problems--why-no-talking-about)
  Again, hits most myths but even makes up some
  new ones. Best quote:

  {:.blockquote}

  > If these systems fail, the reactor starts going into meltdown.
  > Thorium, being a lighter element, doesn't have that problem.

  Being a lighter element has nothing to do with it. Having low-pressure coolant is
  what gives the MSR its safety advantage, dude. SFR, LFR, FHR, etc. are other reactors that
  can do this with or without Thorium. Crikey!

- [Asgard’s fire (The
  Economist)](https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21600656-thorium-element-named-after-norse-god-thunder-may-soon-contribute)
  This article is pretty good in general. But, it has to be on the wall of shame due to this
  quote:

  {:.blockquote}

  > Thorium, though, is hard to turn into a bomb; not impossible, but
  > sufficiently uninviting a prospect that America axed thorium research in the 1970s.

  The MSR program shutdown had nothing to do with MSR's ability to make weapons. Sigh.

- [Thorium: a safer nuclear
  power](https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2014/0328/Thorium-a-safer-nuclear-power)
  This one, focused on China and India's development programs, touches on most of the
  myths and confuses higher melting point as a safety advantage (only relevant for
  solid fuel). Whoops!

- [World's first thorium reactor ready to be built for cheaper, safer nuclear
  energy](https://www.pocket-lint.com/news/129913-world-s-first-thorium-reactor-ready-to-be-built-for-cheaper-safer-nuclear-energy)
  This one was sent in with the subject: "There is a staggering amount of wrong in this
  one." Very true. They claim no operator intervention, not weaponizable, 100 years of
  operation, etc. The whole nine yards!

- [Thorium as a Secure Nuclear Fuel Alternative by A. Canon Bryan](http://ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=187:thorium-as-a-secure-nuclear-fuel-alternative&catid=94:0409content&Itemid=342)
  This one hits on each of the myths, almost in order. It <a
  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2dbh9c/til_experimental_thorium_nuclear_fission_isnt/">was
  posted on reddit TIL</a> and was making it to the front page. A link to this
  page was posted as a comment and made it to the top comment. The TIL mods then
  flagged the post as misleading and it was taken off the front. While we're happy
  to have been a part in reducing the spread of a confusing and misleading
  causation, it's also a little sad that the excitement around Thorium and nuclear
  had to go with it. Thorium is definitely something to be excited about. If only
  people would write sensational articles about it that are less misleading! It's
  hard to balance marketing and truth.

- [Sameer Surampalli Is Thorium the Fuel of the Future to Revitalize
  Nuclear?](https://www.power-eng.com/2019/08/13/is-thorium-the-fuel-of-the-future-to-revitalize-nuclear/#gref)
  (2019-08-13) This article once again conflates thorium as the only way to breed
  and fails to mention that uranium breeders are also possible. It directly violates Myths
  2, 3, and 4 and has a variety of other inaccuracies, such as claiming Thorium MSRs require
  highly-enriched uranium. They don't. They use low enriched uranium.

- [Kirk Sorensen's TEDxYYC Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/kirk_sorensen_thorium_an_alternative_nuclear_fuel)
  (2011-04-15) In this talk with over 600k views Kirk Sorensen presents the
  capabilities of breeder reactors in general, but he tells the story as if the
  only breeder reactor possible is the thorium breeder and does not so much as
  even mention that there are also uranium breeders that have the same
  capabilities. It appears that this may be at the foundation of all the confusion
  we've seen. Having met Kirk on several
  occasions, it's clear that his technical knowledge is solid, so it's extremely
  unlikely that he's ignorant of uranium breeders. It's just unfortunate that the
  time constraints of the TEDx format didn't let him fit in the additional detail
  that the capabilities described come from the concept of breeding rather than
  the concept of Thorium. In my opinion, this detail would have changed the
  entire tone and message of the video.
