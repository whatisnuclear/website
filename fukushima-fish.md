fish radioactive?"/>        

<p>The Fukushima nuclear reactor accident released radioactive atoms
into the environment. Many of these made it into the ocean and have been
found in fish such as Albacore Tuna. Lots of people are concerned about
the health effects of eating such tuna. As such, nuclear people get
asked questions about it a lot.  </p> <p>The <a
href="http://ne.oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University Nuclear
Engineering and Radiation Health Physics Department</a> has some world
experts in radioisotope biological uptake and is involved in several
radiation monitoring programs. Delvan Neville, a graduate student
involved in this research, provided the following summary of their
measurements, and the health implications. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">


<p>"The highest concentrations of Cs-137 and Cs-134 I've seen in albacore
on our coast so far result in a CEDE (committed effective dose
equivalent, which accounts for the type of radiation, the sensitivity of
each organ, and how long any ingested Cs is retained in your body) of
18.01 nSv per kg ingested, which works out to about 330,000 kg to equal
the normal annual dose in the Pacific Northwest (6 mSv, 3 mSv from
natural sources, 3 mSv from mainly medical exposures).  About 1/3rd of
the dose from said highest Cs level albacore is from pre-Fukushima
weapons fallout.  The average american eats about 7 kg of albacore in a
year, which puts an reasonable upper limit of about 126 uSv over the
course of a year, and you'd need to live for over 47,000 years before
you ate enough albacore to result in a CEDE equal to the normal annual
dose.  Even if your entire diet (2,000 calories per day) was nothing
from albacore, and all of it was at the highest levels we've ever seen,
and ignoring the fact this radioactivity is decaying and won't be around
forever, we're talking 578 years before you'd eat enough albacore to
reach that benchmark of 330,000 kg (and end up with a lifetime dose
increase of 0.14%).</p>

<p>For comparison, "spooning" with your partner over 8 hours of sleep
each night results in a dose of 13.40 nSv each month from the
potassium-40 in their body exposing you to additional gamma
irradiation.</p>

<p>Point is, these doses are all ridiculously small, deep deep down
inside the range where we can't definitively say there if there actually
is any risk associated with such a dose.  To be safe, we regulate as if
any dose, no matter how small, carries some risk proportional to a dose
large enough where we can measure an impact.  But biologically, that's
not likely how it works.</p>
