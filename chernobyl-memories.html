        >I don&rsquo;t remember much about Chernobyl&rsquo;s accident because I
        was very little &mdash; only 4 years old. My parents, aged 44 and 47 at
        the time of the accident, my 8 year old sister, and I lived in Gomel
        (Belarus), located less than 100 miles north of Chernobyl. So I asked my
        parents to write what they remember about the accident. My father was a
        professor at a local university, my mother was an engineer.

      In the first days after the Chernobyl accident there was neither news nor
      information about the accident from governmental organizations. People
      already knew something from many other channels: from phone calls of
      relatives living in the accident zone, from railway workers, from messages
      from the Scandinavian countries. I knew about high radioactivity in the
      area the next day because the equipment used by my students to measure the
      density of minerals with radiation in the laboratory read &quot;off
      scale&quot; all the time. Besides this equipment, there were only three
      advanced intermediate-level radiation meters in the city. Two of them were
      taken by .... service<sup

      >. All other detectors were designed for very high measurements in case of
      nuclear war. In a few days, we received Gorbachev's message about the
      accident. Despite of it, the country continued to prepare for the
      celebrations and demonstrations of May 1st<sup

      out of the apartment whenever possible. Then your mom and I made the
      decision to send you to Nizhni Novgorod<sup

      openly and actively for the first, secretly and silently for the second.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information that you and your sister were leaving school was reported
      to the district communist party committee and I was threatened that I
      shall be held responsible for spreading panic. Weather in the end of April
      and beginning of May was sunny, wind was blowing north<sup

      their movement towards Minsk and Moscow.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning of May we were waiting for another explosion, but
      fortunately it did not occur. After the holidays they had started to form
      groups for liquidation of consequences in southern cities. They washed
      houses, trolley buses, buses and sidewalks, and cut the upper layer of the
      soil from lawns.

      and further slowly decreasing. In the forest near our country house on May
      3rd - 100 mR/h. The bus we took - 2500mR/h.

      In Ukrane, a southern hundred-kilometer zone of villages was being
      evacuated (so stupid!<sup

      >). They dug trenches and pushed houses into them and then filled up the
      trenches.
    </p>

    <p>
      The total radioactivity released was 5x10<sup>7</sup> Ci. 70% of all
      emissions settled in Belarus. The height of the emissions was 1 to 1.5 km.
      The main nuclides emitted were plutonium, strontium, cesium, iodine.
      Emission of gases and aerosols stopped basically by May 6th, and in five
      days all had settled on the ground. In the first days air masses were
      moving in northwest direction. More than 41,000 people live in territories
      with contamination of 10-40 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> right now<sup

          >6</a

      >. The main source of contamination now is the consumption of contaminated
      foods, not external irradiation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The increase in diseases (practically all kinds of illnesses) has been
      registered. The reason for this is mainly weak immune systems, but mostly
      it is respiratory diseases, thyroid diseases, and cancer.

      It was on Friday, April 26th, 1986. I was on the sick-list<sup

      with you. You had the chicken pox. But this day I for the first time
      decided to walk you on the street. It was sunny and hot. We walked around
      11 a.m. to the store through a courtyard. I do not remember what we
      bought, but I lost my watch, it simply slipped from my hand. But I had no
      time to think about it because Alain came from school and your dad was
      coming shortly and I had to prepare dinner. When he came the first thing
      he said is that I had to wash all of your and your sister&rsquo;s clothes.
      He mentioned Chernobyl. We looked at the map - just a small town somewhere
      in Ukraine, but close to Belarus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon we had a device that could measure radiation. We began recording
      measurements. I surveyed your sister&rsquo;s clothes before and after
      washing. The difference was dramatic. After April 26th there was a long
      weekend and people certainly used it for getting out camping or just
      spending some time outside. On Monday everybody had started talking about
      the accident. The press was keeping silent. Then the first news arrived.
      They said only one person died at the site - burnt alive in the fire and
      they could not recover the body. Then the number of casualties started to
      grow. They transported everybody (dead and still alive) to Moscow
      hospital. They buried the bodies in a cemetery. There was probably a whole
      cemetery that was radioactive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next time I took you to see a physician, I met a woman who brought her
      children to check for radiation in the waiting room. She had just come
      from Bragino (she had relatives there). Hoyniki, Bragino, Korma, and
      Rogachev were especially radioactive. No one could understand anything
      because radiation was an invisible enemy which caused consequences later.
      Radio and television were mostly quiet, and if there was news, no alarm
      was sound. So I sat at the doctor&rsquo;s office thinking what to do. When
      it was my turn to see the doctor, I asked him about radiation and told him
      my concerns. He didn&rsquo;t give me direct answer at first, but as I kept
      pushing, he said that if I can I should send you as far away from this
      place as possible; he also said that one of the signs of radiation
      exposure is vomiting. When the holiday came, the TV was showing
      demonstrations in Kiev, bicycle races, and other entertaining events.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometime around May 5th there was news about the possibility of a second
      explosion. I was trying to figure out what to do. By that time Alain was
      getting sick. She was vomiting every day after returning from school. She
      was a first grader. We decided to send you to my parents not waiting till
      the end of the school year.
    </p>

    <p>
      I submitted my request of a two-week vacation at work. I also told all my
      co-workers (group of 30 people) to send their children away if they could.
      My manager did not let me take vacation. I did not know then, that it was
      strictly forbidden to all managers to release people from work. Then I
      have asked my manager: &quot;How is your son doing? Is he OK?&quot; He
      didn&rsquo;t answer. Then I said: &quot;Well, maybe your son sleeps well,
      by my daughter vomits every night in bed, therefore here&rsquo;s my
      vacation notice and I&rsquo;m off. I shall be at work on May 18th.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      Your dad took me and the two of you to the train. As we traveled to Nizhni
      Novgorod through Moscow, the train was packed with kids. I was afraid that
      we would be stopped in Moscow at epidemic control. We had to go to
      different train stations, and I chose a route to avoid being stopped.
      Traveling with you was not easy because I had luggage and two little
      children. We took a bus from one station to another, where I met my
      coworker&rsquo;s wife who was taking her two sons to Saratov. When we
      arrived at the station, I sent a telegram to my parents in Nizhni Novgorod
      so they would know when to meet me. It was really hectic at the station; I
      was afraid to lose you and you were not cooperative. You either asked to
      eat, drink, pee, or poop. I barely found the right train, and asked to
      board from the wrong side. It was hard to get up to the train without a
      platform, but we made it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we arrived at our destination we were told that all people from Belarus
      must report to Epidemic Control. So we went there. I told them that we
      were from Gomel. They put as a bus and took us to banya<sup
        >[<a
          href="{% link chernobyl-memories.html %}#foot8"
          onmouseover="domTT_activate(this, event, 'width', '200', 'caption', 'Translator note', 'content', 'A banya is a public bath house similar to a sauna.','trail', true);"
          >8</a
        >]</sup
      >. It was cold, and we had no soap or fresh clothing. It was Saturday so
      most of the stores were closed. I did not wash my hair. After a bath they
      surveyed us with a meter. Then I was told that I should wash my hair once
      again, so I did. Then the guy pointed at you and said to us: &quot;You are
      free to go, but this girl must be transferred to the hospital.&quot; So
      they took us to the hospital. Town Hospital discharged most of the kids
      who could be treated at home to free up places for Chernobyl children. By
      that time, the city was full of children from Belarus. At the hospital, we
      were asked where we came from, why we came, and who had told us to come. I
      told them the truth about where we were from, but I told them I was told
      to come on the TV. Local people were very nice and understanding to us.
      People who wanted to help were bringing food and clothes to the hospital
      for sick kids. Soon there were so many of it that admission office
      prohibited bringing goods for children, because they had no way of storing
      it. After leaving you at the hospital, we returned to my mother&rsquo;s
      house, and she could not understand why I had to wash my children&rsquo;s
      new clothes. I told her that you can&rsquo;t burn radiation and you
      can&rsquo;t brush it off, you can only wash it off.
    </p>

    <p>
      I sent your sister to the local school so she could finish the first
      grade. My vacation was over but you still couldn&rsquo;t be discharged. I
      came back to work and left you and your sister at your grandmother&rsquo;s
      care.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was returning back home with a sense of fulfilled duty; I had put you in
      the care of my parents. But, after getting back to Gomel, my manager
      prepared a surprise for me and other employees who sent their children
      away. He assigned us a project in Korma (30 km inside of the exclusion
      zone) for one month. At the end of the month they took our blood tests,
      but never gave us any results. There were rumors that the Japanese offered
      help, but asked for large payment, so the government turned it down.
      Instead, the government took a compass and drew a 30km circle around
      Chernobyl, and evacuated everybody inside it. However, the spreading of
      radiation was random, so there were clean zones within the exclusion zones
      and contaminated areas in the &quot;clean&quot; ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later we found out that for the first 10 days after the accident we were
      supposed to take antistrumin (an iodine supplement), but it became
      available with prescription only at the end of May.
    </p>

    <p>
      You came back from Russia in the beginning of September. You had an
      appointment with endocrinologist, who checked your thyroid. It was
      abnormally enlarged - second degree<sup
        >[<a

      >. But assessment was done by hands, because no medical equipment was
      available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Government was trying to support kids from contaminated areas with
      financial help and other privileges, and tried to make sure that each
      child would be in a clean zone at least once a year. At the end of May,
      they also put on a show and even Gorbachov and his wife went to the
      destroyed nuclear plant and Pugachova<sup

      gave a concert there. But after USSR's crisis there was no money, they
      stopped paying us alimony and declared Gomel a &quot;clean&quot; zone.
