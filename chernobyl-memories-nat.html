      I was 4 years old when Chernobyl accident happened and I don&rsquo;t
      remember anything. Chernobyl didn&rsquo;t affect my life
      <a href="{% link chernobyl-memories.html %}">the way it did my parents</a
      >. And this is understandable &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t have two kids to take
      care of, or all the bureaucracy to fight with and communist party to be
      afraid of &ndash; I was only four, and probably didn&rsquo;t care much for
      anything except ice-cream and my toys. Nevertheless, Chernobyl became an
      inseparable part of my life &ndash; I grew up with it. It&rsquo;s like
      being a blind person, who was born blind and doesn&rsquo;t care much for
      sight because he doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to see. It was
      the same with me &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t care that Chernobyl happened
      just because I never knew a life without it.

    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.49in; margin-top: 0.08in">
      Since I remember myself I heard the word Chernobyl many times and knew
      that it was something bad. But I didn&rsquo;t see how it was bad, because
      I didn&rsquo;t think that it had anything to do with me. Sure I did have
      to go to my grandparents&rsquo;, who lived in Russia, for the whole summer
      ever since Chernobyl happened, but it was fun! And sure I had an enlarged
      thyroid, but it didn&rsquo;t hurt, and I never got cancer, and
      didn&rsquo;t even know that I could get it or what it was. It required
      yearly check ups, but that wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. 90% of the kids that I
      knew had the same problem, so from a child&rsquo;s point of view, there
      was nothing wrong with me because the majority of the kids were the same
      way. In fact, I thought there was something wrong with the kids who
      didn&rsquo;t have enlarged thyroids &ndash; they were weird&hellip;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.49in; margin-top: 0.08in">
      The first time I ever understood that I was that &ldquo;blind
      person&rdquo; happened when I was about 8 years old. I met a Russian boy
      at a play ground during my multiple trips to visit my grandparents in
      Russia. I wanted to impress him with something, so I told him a joke that
      I overheard in one of the adult conversations about strontium. He looked
      at me strangely and asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s strontium?&rdquo; And I
      said: &ldquo;Well, you know, it&rsquo;s that stuff in your bones!&rdquo;
      And he looked at me even more strangely and said: &ldquo;I never heard
      about it&rdquo;. &ldquo;Come on, of course you have, everybody has
      it!&rdquo; &ndash; I protested. &rdquo;I don&rsquo;t think I do!&rdquo;
      And then it occurred to me that he probably was right, and he didn&rsquo;t
      have it. It was only me, who was bound to laugh at jokes about strontium
      in my bones, because that was the only thing I could do, I could never
      take Chernobyl out of my life!

    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.49in; margin-top: 0.08in">
      Based on the level of contamination, the land around Chernobyl was divided
      into three zones: the 30km exclusion zone &ndash; no one lived there, the
      contaminated zone &ndash; we had a few kids from those areas in school,
      and the zone with mild contamination &ndash; that&rsquo;s where I lived.
      So in school we used to make fun of the kids from more contaminated zones,
      joking that they glow at night. However, in the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; cites,
      I was the one to make fun of, because I was from a more contaminated zone.
      I also got higher allowance from the government than other students,
      because I was from a contaminated city, so I couldn&rsquo;t really
      complain about that.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.49in; margin-top: 0.08in">
      The only other thing from my childhood that separated me from other kids
      was the fact that we had a Geiger counter at home (my dad got one
      somewhere at work). In fact, as years went by we got a few of those, and,
      let me tell you, those were really fun to play with! Especially the ones
      that had check sources! This was probably what eventually led me to my
      career choice of being nuclear engineer!
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.49in; margin-top: 0.08in">
      So the realization of the full scale of Chernobyl accident didn&rsquo;t
      come until much later in my life. I always considered myself lucky in
      comparison to thousands of other kids, who actually had moved out of their
      homes, who got sick, had cancer or even died.
