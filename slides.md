The slide deck here describes our current energy context and explains how
nuclear energy fits in. We are releasing them with CC-BY-NC licensing hoping
they'd be used around the world.

<h2 class="text-center" markdown="1">[Click here to view the slides]({% link slides/nuclear-overview.html %})</h2>

The slides are made with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), which is a web-based
slide technology somewhat similar to Powerpoint, but you just present them from
the browser. It is a **two dimensional** slide deck, where you go **left to
right** for each major section and then
**down** to see the details. You can use the arrow keys to navigate. It's
organized so that you can always just do the first few slides of a section
before pressing the right arrow key to go on to the next topic, so you can cull
the slides as needed for your audience or time allotment.

To navigate through all slides in order, press the **space** bar rather than the
arrow keys. Use the **Home** and **End** buttons to go to the beginning or end of
the deck.

There is a speaker view and speaker notes that describe to you the presenter what's
going on. Press the **S** key to open speaker view in a separate window.

Many images lazy-load, so you should have an internet connection to give this presentation.
