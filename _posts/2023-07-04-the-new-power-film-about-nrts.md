We're excited to announce the recent digitization of this 1965 film summarizing the
test reactors and other activities of the National Reactor Testing Station
(NRTS), known today as the [Idaho National Lab
(INL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_National_Laboratory).
This is the second of _four_ historical nuclear films in our
latest batch of 4K digitizations from 16mm film at the National Archives.
