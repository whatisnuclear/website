## The N.S. Savannah at the Seattle World's Fair 1962

My journey to digitizing this video actually started when [I happened
upon](https://x.com/whatisnuclear/status/1652827641819574273) [a quote in
an old document that
said](https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/87-ns-savannah-1962.pdf):

<blockquote class="blockquote">
"Considered by some marine engineers the most beautiful ship ever built, the
sleek white SAVANNAH was shown off to the crowds at the 1962 Seattle Worldâ€™s
Fair"
</blockquote>

And so, I sought out a picture of N.S. Savannah in Seattle. By going through the
newspaper archives around the time of her visit, [I found a bad-quality scan of
the Savannah with the Space
Needle](https://x.com/whatisnuclear/status/1654133262309281795) from the
[October 2 1962
Seattle PI newspaper](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.ezproxy.spl.org/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=C12EB6BE1393489FA580F5880B8B058E&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Aimage%252Fv2%253A142FE773BA94746A%2540EANX-NB-16D6365F762EAF47%25402437940-16D630242953EE36%25402-16D630242953EE36%2540/hlterms%3A).
The more I looked, the more I decided I needed to get this film digitized,
hoping it would have shots from Seattle. And sure enough, it did. But I also
wanted to see if I could find the photo from the newspaper. I called local
museums and libraries. The MOHAI in Seattle dug through their records and found
negatives of Savannah. I ordered scans of two of them and get the rights to post
them here. Behold!

## Photos from video production

Right after we digitized this, Alice Orleans Jordon, the daughter of the film's
producer, Sam Orleans, reached out and shared some photos from their personal
collection. She's in the film as a child at 22:07 with her mother. She recalls:

{:.blockquote}

> They served us fruit cocktail for these takes. I remember it was chilled. I
> was so impressed! There was a white baby grand piano in the lounge--I learned to
> play chopsticks on it. The lounge had white, plush carpet. I remember how good
> it felt on my bare feet!

Here are her photos:
