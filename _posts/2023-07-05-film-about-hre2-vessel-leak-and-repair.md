We're **super** excited to announce the recent digitization of a 1961 film
detailing a major repair of the **Homogeneous Reactor Experiment-2 (HRE-2)**, a
fluid-fueled aqueous homogeneous reactor at the Oak Ridge National Lab in
Tennessee This reactor was an early predecessor to [molten salt reactors]({%
link msr.md %}). This is the third of four historical nuclear films in our
latest batch of 4K digitizations from 16mm film at the National Archives.

HRE-2 developed a hole that leaked fluid fuel from the core region into the
heavy water blanket region. They adjusted procedures and operated in this
condition for a while. Later, it developed a second hole and they decided to
repair it. This film shows highly specialized tools and equipment allowing them
to diagnose and repair the holes remotely. Inside the core the radiation dose
rate was a nearly-unbelievable 100,000 R/hr.

I read the story of the HRE-2 vessel leak many years ago in [Alvin Weinberg's
autobiography]({% link weinberg.md %}) (pg 124), so when I learned that there
was an old video describing its repair, I knew it had to be digitized. This is
an extremely rare film that probably hasn't been viewed by hardly anyone since
the 1960s... until today!
