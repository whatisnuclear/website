We've posted a big directory of [old Atomic Energy Commission videos]({% link
old-videos.md %}). To make it, we read through old listings of video summaries,
cross-referenced them with the National Archives to get links to 16mm film if
they exist, and also cross-referenced against YouTube and other places where one
can find such videos already. The net result is a listing of existing videos as
well as a listing of not-yet-digitized-but-available-on-film videos, in
prioritized order of how awesome they are.
