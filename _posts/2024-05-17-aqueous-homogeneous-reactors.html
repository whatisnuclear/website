  Let me tell you about Aqueous Homogeneous Research Reactors.
  These were reactors with fluid fuel: an aqueous solution of uranium. Aka
  "water-boiler" type reactors.  The first few were made at LANL during the 
  Manhattan Project. Later, Atomics International sold them for research.

            These reactors were nice for research because they were small,
            inherently safe due to strong negative reactivity feedbacks, "easy"
            to maintain, and could be operated with a small crew. Here's one

            Because the fissions are happening amongst the water, radiolytic
            decomposition of water happened constantly. 10 liters of hydrogen
            and oxygen gases are released per minute when operating at 50 kW.
            Gas recombiners were developed to deal with this.

            The recombiner offered a somewhat unique experimental capability,
            where the decaying fission gases would release strong gammas far
            away from the neutrons. Having pure-gamma facilities was useful for
            much research.
