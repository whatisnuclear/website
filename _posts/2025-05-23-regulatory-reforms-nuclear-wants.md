Everyone says nuclear power is over-regulated. With word of the big nuclear EOs
looming, I spent a few weeks talking to people in the nuclear industry to find
out which reforms they thought would be most helpful, and which they were
nervous about. Here are the top 12.

1:üå≥ **Keep fixing NEPA**. We should default to Environmental Assessments instead of
Environmental Impact Statements on sites with previous or generic EIS from
within the last ~10 years, and for low-risk reactors. We should accelerate the
ongoing implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and remove/reduce the
need for power and alternates analyses sections for any reactor.

Specifically, someone could ask the NRC staff to proceed with rulemaking to
update/modernize 10 CFR Part 51. Overlaps nicely with ongoing work to implement
FRA. See [SECY-24-0046](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2407/ML24078A013.html).
Remove the requirement in 10 CFR 51.20 to require an environmental impact
statement for nuclear power plant applications and power uprates. Provide
allowance for categorical exclusions for advanced reactors and power uprates in
10 CFR 51.22. In lieu of categorical exclusions, allow for environmental
assessment for first-of-a-kind facilities in 10 CFR 51.21 and a categorical
exclusion for nth-of-a-kind facilities and power uprates in 10 CFR 51.22.

<hr/>

2: üìàIncrease NRC staffing focused on new reactor licensing. The nuclear
ecosystem is thriving, and dozens of new applicants are expected to hit the NRC
soon. Staff has to be there in order to perform the reviews. I‚Äôd say this was
the biggest and most common concern from across the nuclear industry.

While doing so, it's important to continue the positive implementation of
cultural changes brought in by [the ADVANCE
act](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws/advance-act.html) and related
legislation. The NRC is there to ensure that the numerous benefits we can get
from nuclear power are achieved safely.

<hr/>

3: üéõÔ∏èImprove dashboards, visibility, and timelines around Commission voting.
The Commission often sits on votes for years, one example being NEPA Part 51
rulemaking.

Furthermore, after passing something to the NRC, licensees don‚Äôt have any idea
what the status is of submittal; they have to call their PM, and they ask
someone else‚Ä¶ it should just be online.

Create public dashboards that show what the Commissioners are voting on
(including how long something‚Äôs been sitting in their queue) and what the status
of review is during licensing.

The operating fleet side of the NRC website [has excellent
dashboards](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/oversight/docket-chart.html?docket=cook1)
(e.g. how many White findings did plant x have last year?) so just do something
like that for Commissioner votes and license submittals. Easy!

<hr/>

4: üß∑ Encourage use of **commercial-grade Quality Assurance standards** on
safety-related design, procurement, maintenance, etc. instead of special
nuclear-grade ones where extra quality from nuclear-grade QA does not have a
major impact on public health.

Modern redundancy and passive safety design increases tolerances of failures.
Certain structures (e.g. 50-ton concrete blocks) will protect against various
internal and external events to a large degree with normal industrial QA
standards. Special nuclear-grade standards increase costs, and prevent many
vendors from selling to nuclear plants. There are even examples where going to
specialized nuclear-grade standards requires a whole new one-off line, which can
decrease overall quality and safety. Update guidance to endorse ISO-9001 QA
programs to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix B. Applicants can and
often do commit to commercial-grade standards for certain components.

<hr/>
5: üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Improve and encourage the NRC‚Äôs ability to perform consultation for
licensees and prospective licensees. There‚Äôs a lingering tradition for the NRC
staff to never directly answer questions, but rather to just always ask for more
information, even if the NRC knows that something would be wrong if submitted as
is. This leads to a legalistic and adversarial relationship and wastes time in
communication cycles. There is zero legal or regulatory basis for this behavior;
it‚Äôs a culture that arose from nothing at some point within the NRC. The culture
has been improving dramatically in the last 10 years, which is great. Encourage
and enable the NRC more collaborative in the safety mission by allowing them to
‚Äòconsult‚Äô in this manner. Put out an official policy statement proclaiming that
this kind of consultation and collaboration is allowed and encouraged. Allow
fast non-public NRC/vendor communication, akin to group chats. Note that this
may include additional fees, which could improve cost efficiency of NRC.

<hr/>

6: ‚ò¢Ô∏è Replace ‚ÄúAs low as reasonably attainable‚Äù (ALARA) with **specific
sub-background dose limit** of, like, 0.1 mSv/yr/person. ALARA is ill-defined
and vague, can be abused to cause far more time and money to be spent for
in-the-noise health benefits, especially in operations, decommissioning, and
waste design. By cutting it off well under natural background, safety is not
compromised. Declare: ‚Äúfor ALARA considerations, anything expected to give a
best estimate dose of 0.1 mSv/person/year or less to any given person shall be
considered ALARA‚Äù. This very low limit won‚Äôt please the anti-LNT folks out
there, but there is still plenty of scientific evidence supporting LNT, so any
further declarations would require additional careful scientific analysis.
Low-dose radiation effects are an extremely difficult problem to study, leaving
Alvin Weinberg to once [call it
‚Äútrans-scientific‚Äù](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.177.4045.211),
meaning a question that could be asked scientifically but were beyond the
scientific method to answer.

<hr/>

7:ü§ù **Eliminate mandatory uncontested** hearing in section 189a of the Atomic
Energy Act. The thoroughness of contemporary NRC technical review renders this
unnecessary. Transparency is now handled by public outreach, scoping meetings at
reactor sites, and global availability of application documents and staff
evaluations on the NRC‚Äôs website, and US government transparency laws. The
hearing takes time and money (up to 10,000 staff hours), and slows the
regulatory process down with very little, if any, benefit. See [Bowen,
2023](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/improving-the-efficiency-of-nrc-power-reactor-licensing-the-1957-mandatory-hearing-reconsidered/).

This is statutory, and needs Congressional work: pick up on progress from NRC‚Äôs
2008 draft law proposal discussed in Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee (April 21, 2016) and the House Energy and Commerce Committee (April
29, 2016) and push it through.

Have the Commissioners go to Congress and do this. Congress wouldn‚Äôt let it
through in 2008 but things have changed and Congress is perfect for it now.
Would be easy.

<hr/>

8:ü¶∫ The Commission should encourage more flexibility around the licensing of
reactors under class-103 and 104 licenses. Allow **any reactor that can meet
certain off-site dose criteria to use class-104-like regulations** by
eliminating end-use, power, and revenue criteria. If a reactor can demonstrably
retain radiation below a certain limit in all normal and credible accident
scenarios even if all structures/systems/components (SSCs) fail, then the
regulations imposed upon the SSCs should be reduced, regardless of power level,
use case, and revenue. Push along the lines of
[2024-30721](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/30/2024-30721/non-power-production-or-utilization-facility-license-renewal)
to further clarify and re-define ‚Äònon-power production or utilization facility‚Äô
into something like ‚Äòlow dose risk facility‚Äô.

<hr/>

9:üçÉ Officially **endorse using existing NOAA or other agency weather data** and
models for site characterization rather than requiring that a meteorological
tower be erected. The ‚Äúmet tower‚Äù guidance in [RG
1.23](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0703/ML070350028.pdf) calls for a 12 months of
data for a construction permit and 24 months for an operating license, including
the most recent 1 year period. This imposes a long period of time to the process
of building any reactor at a new site. Adjust RG 1.23 to endorse use of results
from weather modeling based on existing weather sensors, including satellite
weather data. Weather monitoring and modeling has undergone untold advances
since this type of guidance was made.

<hr/>

10:üíÇ **Reduce Force-on-Force security drills** at plants. More than are notionally
required are being done to comply with a requirement that every single officer
can perform in a drill. Plants do more than 10 per year to meet this even though
only 4 are required.

<hr/>

11:üü© Eliminate the possibility of getting a white violation during Emergency
Preparedness drills. Green violations should be the max possible from drills.
**Whites should only be determined during an actual event**.

<hr/>

12: üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èProvide more Commission oversight and prioritization of the Advisory
Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS). They are very useful for reviewing new
and novel things, but the NRC staff technical capabilities have dramatically
improved since the ACRS's founding in the early AEC days. Keep them focused on
new and novel things and minimize redundancy with staff capabilities and work.

<hr/>

The nuclear industry does have a policy wing that‚Äôs heavily engaged in ongoing
reforms, so I didn‚Äôt really expect to find anything too surprising. But with the
big nuclear Executive Orders coming out (earlier today), talking to friends and their
networks still seemed worthwhile to get the latest info.

A big thanks to all respondents to the survey. And a huge thanks to the policy
professionals who guided and taught me much about this space, and who have
worked tirelessly to actually implement these and other reforms. I‚Äôm humbled and
thankful for their guidance and support. Brett Rampal was extremely helpful, as always.
