In case you missed it, watch and read about our efforts to digitize a [historic video
about ZPPR from the AEC]({% link _posts/2022-12-19-zppr-film-scanned.md %}). There's also a wishlist of related
videos that we will work to get digitized in the future. Secret hint, there are two
of them are in the works!

We made [this reactor table breaking them down by coolant and moderator]({% link reactors.md %}#types).

Under the hood we ran a bunch of link checkers and updated most of our broken links. We also
ran the W3C validator on all pages and fixed up all the validation errors and warnings.
