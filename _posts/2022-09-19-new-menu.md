<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">

We upgraded from Bootstrap 3 to 5 but kept most of the look and feel similar.
Along the way, we decided to re-organize the top menu and all the categories.
This should help make things easier to find. I got rid of the 'blog' section
and brought all those posts out into the regular menu in the appropriate
category.

Also, I got rid of the 'nuclear-energy' page and just merged it with the main
from page that tells the whole story.

I did change up a lot of the front page as well, packing most of the pros and
cons into collapsible boxes that will help the page seem like less of
a wall of text.

Hope you enjoy it!
