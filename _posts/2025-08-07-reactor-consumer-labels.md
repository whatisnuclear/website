Reactor discussions are most productive when informed by a clear understanding
of the reactors involved. Therefore, I propose we begin using standardized
Nuclear Reactor Consumer Labels to display key information.

Just as nutrition facts on cereal boxes are governed by the Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 1990 (codified in 21 CFR 101.9), these labels would provide
a consistent and valuable resource. The Broadband Label Order (codified in [47
CFR
8.2](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-8/subpart-A/section-8.2))
further demonstrates the effectiveness of standardized labels, requiring
internet service providers to display Broadband Consumer Labels, often referred
to as broadband nutrition labels, offering clear, standardized, and accurate
information.

Standardized Nuclear Reactor Consumer Labels would be a beneficial addition. You
can find definitions of the proposed fields on our [advanced reactor page]({%
link advanced-reactors.md %}#useful-reactor-data).

Taxpayers, investors, and other stakeholders involved in reactor development
programs should rightfully **demand access to at least this fundamental
information** from prospective reactor vendors. This information, a general
definition of the reactor, is not proprietary or subject to export controls. If
a vendor doesn't provide it, I would generally advise against investing or
supporting their project.
