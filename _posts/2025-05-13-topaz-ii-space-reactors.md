In the early 1990s, the USA purchased 6 TOPAZ-II space nuclear reactors from the
USSR/Russia and flew them to New Mexico for testing. These reactors had
thermionic cells around each of their 37 fuel pins: "Thermionic Fuel Elements"
(TFE)!

The 115 kWt reactors used 93% enriched annular UO<sub>2</sub> fuel elements, which
transferred heat through a cesium gap, converting about 5% of the heat to
electricity. Outside each pin, they had electromagnetically-pumped liquid metal
sodium-potassium eutectic coolant.

The pins were dispersed in a ZrH<sub>1.85</sub> moderator. There were beryllium
reflectors and beryllium control drums, each with a 116° strip of boron
absorber. They had LiH and stainless steel radiation shielding. The reactors
consumed 0.5 g of Cesium per day.

In 1989, the TOPAZ lead came to Albuquerque and expressed interest in
collaborating with the US. The US's space concept, the SP-100, was over budget
and behind schedule, so the TOPAZ could be a good deal. A series of meetings
followed. At one, a model of the reactor was brought along and displayed.

In a true show of bureaucratic absurdity, when the Soviets tried to take their
conference model back out of the USA, the NRC banned it, saying that it would be
an export. This was back when the NRC was a true pain.

On April 26, 1992, a C-141 and a C-130 came to pick up the first reactor. There
was some trouble with identifying which of the 80+ crates had hazardous
material, and at one point someone had to run to furniture stores to get some
foam padding, but they got it loaded. However, the export officer at the St.
Petersburg airport would not accept the export license because it had been
signed by the USSR, which had in the meanwhile ceased to exist! More meetings
were had and eventually a new license was approved. Airplane maintenance and air
clearance rights persistent, but eventually the delivery was made!

Another deliver of 4 more reactors was made in 1994.

The US did ground testing and planned to fly them. Ex-Soviet scientists came and
helped at the University of New Mexico. Russian language training was provided.
In the end, a flight test never happened due to budget constraints and
anti-nuclear sentiment, though staff was proud of what they accomplished:

"We were able to convince critics and openly hostile groups that NEPSTP could be
carried out safely. I believe that the success of our approach will set a
valuable standard for all future space reactor missions."

I wonder if we can dust these off and fly them now!?
