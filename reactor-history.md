_"You have to know the past to understand the present"_ — Carl Sagan

The dream for economical nuclear power was born well before the discovery of nuclear
fission, but the quest for it began in earnest in the late 1940s and involved some 100,000
persons for several decades in the USA alone. This page is a grand tour of reactor
development programs from 1945 to about 1970, also known as _the nuclear heyday_. As we proceed
with new reactor development programs today, remembering what was done back then may help
us navigate developments of the future.

Our [economics page]({% link economics.md %}) discusses developments and
economics from 1970 to the present.

## The starting point

When nuclear fission was discovered in 1938, <sup>235</sup>U existed at 0.7% in natural
Uranium (decayed down from over 25% when Earth was formed). Without isotopic enrichment
available (of uranium or hydrogen in water), only a handful of configurations could
sustain a chain reaction. Enrico Fermi and co. figured it out by 1942, and operated the
first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1), using pieces of natural uranium metal
dispersed carefully in a lattice of high-purity graphite blocks in a Chicago squash court.

Developments in other countries are not well covered here. Also, the chains
of events are difficult to classify so the time linearity of the following is not perfect.
</div>

### Nuclear weapons production reactors

Vast wealth and effort was first invested in nuclear reactor development because the
unique characteristics of the atomic chain reaction could provide fundamental and dramatic
military strategic advantages. Accordingly, the first high-power reactors were designed
and built to produce [plutonium as fuel for nuclear explosives]({% link hanford.md %}).
As in CP-1, they had natural uranium fuel dispersed in a graphite moderator.

</figure>

Unlike CP-1, the Hanford reactors were cooled with ordinary water. Since water is a
neutron absorber, the reactor had to be large, and it required extra-pure graphite with
minimal neutron-absorbing impurities (like boron). It also needed a lot of
metallic natural uranium. Eugene Wigner proposed cooling with low-pressure,
low-temperature water instead of high-temperature, high-pressure helium because he was
worried that the fuel would not survive high temperatures, and that pumping and
maintaining an inventory of helium would be challenging. His calculations showed that a
water-cooled reactor would indeed chain-react, and his unwavering drive to beat the Nazis
bolstered his confidence. Water-cooled reactors were built.

After the plutonium-producing _B reactor_ at Hanford was operational, the scientists who
designed it began imagining a better time, beyond the war, when the newfound power of
the atom could be applied to the peaceful enrichment of humankind. The first documented
reactor innovation sessions occurred around this time. Many reactor concepts were dreamed
up at these _New Piles Committee_ meetings. No one knew whether
nuclear-powered electricity generating stations could be cost-competitive with
conventional power plants.

Review</a> from October, 1944 where a longer discussion of their views of future reactors
is recorded. They thought pressurized water would lead to corrosion issues at high
temperature and considered liquid metal (specifically lead-bismuth) to be the most
promising coolant. Written 5 days after Hanford B came online, it does have a <a

best shield.</figcaption> </figure>

### Putting nuclear heat to work

After the war, the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) took responsibility for US
nuclear technology, as authorized by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. Building up new
weapons material production capabilities and weapons technology dominated its efforts,
but power reactor development did legitimately begin at this time.

Truly exotic energy conversion was seriously considered in the 1940s
(thermionics, endothermic chemical reactions, etc.), but converting heat to
electricity in a standard steam cycle was considered the easiest way to reach
economical nuclear power. This conversion requires high-temperature,
long-endurance fuel that can withstand an intense radiation environment. This
was a fundamental technological departure from the plutonium-production
reactors, which generated heat only as a nuisance and were kept at low
temperature. [Robert Oppenheimer explained this
well](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d03584627s&view=1up&seq=199).

In 1947, the AEC proposed and funded four new reactors, all of which made use of
new availability of enriched uranium rather than natural uranium
[[ref](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112101598057&seq=770)]. All
four were completed in the early 1950s:

- Fast reactor — A fast reactor to explore the possibilities of breeding (now known as EBR-1)
- Navy thermal reactor — a prototype for submarine propulsion (now known as STR or S1W)
- Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) — A testing facility to investigate potential materials
  to be used in power reactor construction. The resistance of materials to the environment
  required for power production was the primary challenge of power reactor development.
- Knolls intermediate reactor — to explore the possibilities of breeding and to develop usable
  power (soon repurposed as another submarine prototype, called SIR and/or S1G)

The first three were built in Idaho, thus creating what was then called the National
Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) and is now the Idaho National Lab (INL). The fourth was built
north of Schenectady, NY in a giant sphere at the center of Knolls Atomic Power Lab's
Kesselring site. During design of the MTR, Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) built a
mechanical mockup reactor, which they then converted to a real reactor called LITR: the
first water-cooled, water-moderated reactor.

## Specialized military reactors after WWII

As nuclear weapons have orders of magnitude more destructive force over conventional
explosives, nuclear engines for submarines, ships, rockets, and aircraft offer orders of
magnitude more range than conventional fuels. Accordingly, the next major application of
the chain reactor was in specialized military contexts.

### Naval reactors

The nuclear-propelled Navy was developed by Captain Hyman G. Rickover. Rickover's role in
the development of naval propulsion goes without saying, but his influence on the
commercial industry simply cannot be overstated. He was born in 1900 in a Polish ghetto,
moved to New York at the age of 6, and then to Chicago's West Side. He entered the Naval
Academy in 1918 and requested submarine service in 1929. He translated _Das Unterseeboot_
from the Imperial German Navy as a labor of personal interest. In 1937, he became a
Engineering Duty Only (EDO) officer, focused on the design, construction, and maintenance
of ships. After WWII ended, he was sent to Oak Ridge to learn about nuclear technology as
part of a team to investigate nuclear ship propulsion. He established himself as the
leader of the team and fought hard to secure funds and authority to kick off the naval
reactors program.

He kicked off two reactor development programs in parallel for naval propulsion: the
sodium-cooled beryllium-reflected/moderated reactor (Project Genie) and the pressurized
water reactor (Project Wizard).

#### The PWR and the _Nautilus_

Alvin Weinberg and the Oak Ridge team suggested using pressurized water as a submarine
reactor coolant and moderator for two reasons: (1) the distance neutrons in water travel
is one-fifth the distance they travel in graphite, so the water reactor could be very
compact (good for small enclosed spaces), and (2) water systems are simple, familiar, and
reliable in a naval context. The ORNL team made preliminary sketches of such a reactor.

The preliminary work of ORNL was transferred to Argonne along with a team of engineers who
were coming off the just-cancelled _Daniels Pile_ project, which had attempted to
develop a high-temperature pebble-bed gas-cooled power reactor using highly-enriched uranium.

Against the prevailing wisdom (e.g. of Weinberg), Rickover boldly decided to build the
full-scale Nautilus prototype reactor (STR) in Idaho without first building a much-cheaper
pilot model. Simultaneously, construction of the Nautilus submarine itself began in
Connecticut. Rickover's ruthless and aggressive schedule was driven by a conviction that
whoever developed nuclear engines first would rule the seas.

Rickover strictly required that the two projects fit together. At one inspection, he
forced the Idaho team to move a coffee maker outside the hull since it would not be in the
real submarine.

During STR development, the effect of radiation on components and equipment was tested in
the MTR. Vast programs successfully developed the hermetically sealed pumps with
appropriate bearings, thin stainless steel or Inconel liners, motor winding cooling, and
high-pressure electrical terminal seals. A complete line of hermetically sealed,
hydraulically operated stainless steel primary system valves was developed.
Welding of heavy wall stainless piping was developed. Weldability and weld
cracking as functions of material composition was found and understood. Design criteria
for auxiliary systems supporting waste disposal, coolant purification, emergency cooling,
fuel handling, ventilation, as well as feasible engineering techniques to satisfy the
requirements were developed.

STR went critical on March 31, 1953 and reached full power by May 31.

After a massive reactor technology development program and the operation of a land-based
prototype reactor in Idaho, the second major application of nuclear reactors became the
[propulsion system of naval submarines]({% link propulsion.md %}), marked by the message
from the USS Nautilus on Jan 17, 1955:

> UNDERWAY ON NUCLEAR POWER

  </figure>

The astoundingly high energy density of nuclear fuel allowed the submariners to gallivant on wild new
adventures, such as reaching the [North Pole under
ice](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nautilus_(SSN-571)#Operation_Sunshine_%E2%80%93_under_the_North_Pole>)
for the first time and [circumnavigating the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sandblast) in one non-stop submerged
session for the first time. Such high adventures are remembered by people who were young
at the time (like Gwyneth Cravens) as deeply inspiring.

#### The SIR and the _Seawolf_

The sodium-cooled intermediate-spectrum power breeder that GE was working on for
the AEC at KAPL was initially intended to develop the world's first economic
civilian power reactor. However, it got repurposed into the Naval Reactors
development program on April 14, 1950 due to two factors: a) it had become clear
by this time that the desired demonstration was more challenging than
anticipated, and b) the darkening military situation with the USSR necessitated
priority on military mobile submarine reactors
[[source](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d03584627s&view=1up&seq=25)].

The reactor there became the land-based prototype for the _USS Seawolf_. At
first, Rickover preferred the sodium-cooled approach with a beryllium
reflector/moderator because it used silent electro-magnetic pumps and offered
very high thermal efficiency. The prototype (S1G) experienced leaks in the
superheaters due to an incompatibility between the liquid metal sodium and the
particular steel used. Because of Rickover's insistence in building prototype
concurrently with the real thing, the real _Seawolf_ also experienced
superheater leaks. They plugged tubes, performed difficult repairs (sodium has
high induced radioactivity and high chemical reactivity), and eventually
bypassed the superheater. _Seawolf_ worked at reduced efficiency, logged some
tens of thousands of hours, but eventually had its propulsion system swapped out
for a PWR.

### Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion

Alongside the naval propulsion project, the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program was
launched. Long-range bombers that could stay in the air for months or years at a time
with unlimited range were thought to be militarily important. In addition, significant R&D
on nuclear-powered cruise missiles and scramjets was performed.

</div>

The ANP was a massive program spanning more than 10 years and a billion (1955) dollars.
JFK ended the program early in his presidency at the recommendation of Alvin Weinberg.
Progress in ICBMs effectively eliminated the need for nuclear-powered bombers. The molten
salt reactor technology still actively discussed today is a direct descendent from this
massive development program.

### The Army Nuclear Power Program

With the Navy and Air Force reactor programs in full swing, the Army was not to be left
out. The Army Nuclear Power Program (ANPP) focused on the deployment of very small
reactors to remote locations. It got going in the late 1950s and early 1960s, well after
the Navy and Air Force programs. Small nuclear reactors were built and tested at factories
and then transported to, re-assembled, and operated in a military ice base in Greenland
([Camp Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28NYczAuXl4)), McMurdo Station in
Antarctica, the Panama canal on a mobile barge, Sundance Air Force Station in Wyoming, and
Fort Greely, Alaska. An exotic nitrogen-cooled truck-mounted model was developed and
tested in Idaho but not deployed.

After the STG and Nautilus, the third PWR to operate was the first plant built under the ANPP: the
APPR-1 (later designated SM-1). It was built by Alco and Stone & Webster, and
came to power in April, 1957. While the Shippingport design effort predates APPR-1 effort
(discussed below), the APPR-1 team pioneered some ideas, such as the vertical vapor
container, as opposed to Shippingport's horizontal ones. They innovated a lot while
considering internal missile protection, but ended up with a rather expensive reinforcing
job.

Before fabricating the fuel, Alco Products built a critical testing facility to perform
zero-power experiments with their proposed fuel and control design. The mock-up core
was built in a 2500 sq. ft. facility, and by 1957 they were soliciting other companies to
perform related experiments in it.

The PM-3A and PM-2A remote military reactors in Antarctica and Greenland were also PWRs.

## The development of civilian reactors

### AEC Civilian Reactor Programs

The AEC executed several programs specifically dedicated to the quest for economical
nuclear power. In this period, its prospects were highly tentative, and the magnitude of
work needed to achieve it was regularly estimated somewhat accurately (3-5 years to make a
little power, 20-30 years before contributing significant power). Nonetheless, everyone
was eager to see if it could be done.

#### The 5-year plan

In 1954, the AEC announced the government-funded _Five-Year Plan_ to explore reactor
concepts from a commercial point of view. They included:

- Shippingport Pressurized Water Reactor
- Experimental Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR)
- Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE)
- Homogeneous Reactor Experiment-2 (HRE-2)
- Experimental Breeder Reactor-2 (EBR-2)

#### Atoms for Peace

Eisenhower (the first Republican president in 20 years) vastly increased the AEC's focus
on private participation in nuclear technology with his famous [December 1953 Atoms for
Peace speech](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/multimedia/videos/atoms-peace-speech).
The first international conference on peaceful uses of atomic energy was held in Geneva
in 1955. It was an incredible event filled with optimism and excitement.
Private funding, ownership, and operation was on its way.

</figure>
</div>

</div>

Volume 2 of the delegation report (June 24, 1955), recorded AEC Chairman Strauss giving a
rousing speech about how American industry was willing to cover 90% of the Power
Development Reactor Program plant costs. He also hinted at the political situation,
justifying the stockpiling of weapons as protection against "menaces from those who have
destroyed freedom in the expansion of their own ruthless philosophy". While investments
in conventional weapons could only be recovered as scrap in times of peace, the nuclear
material being stockpiled could be used later for peaceful purposes:

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start">
But when the day comes that our atomic armament is no longer required to deter 
aggression, the nuclear material which it contains can be easily converted into 
energy sources to provide very great amounts of power to turn the wheels of industry,
furnish us with light, heat, transportation, and the many other conveniences 
and blessing of peace. We who work in the Atomic Energy Commission work with 
the vision of that day before us.
</blockquote>
</figure>

<div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
Sidenote: this vision really did come true when between 2003 and 2013, fully 10% of the
USA's electric power was derived from dismantled ex-Soviet nuclear bombs.
</div>

Certainly Atoms for Peace contained an element of propaganda. All involved wanted to
realize a peaceful application for horrifying weapons. By this time, thermonuclear fusion
"H-bombs" had been developed, which were literally 1000x more powerful than the atomic
bombs dropped on Japan. Their horrible implications almost defy comprehension.
Nonetheless, applying the newfound force of nature to the betterment of civilization by
making useful power was a noble goal.

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header text-white bg-success"><strong>Pressure from abroad</strong></div>
  <div class="card-body" markdown="1">
Competing with other countries was a top concern voiced frequently in Congressional
hearings from the early 1950s. The UK got the first full-scale commercial production of
electric power from a dual-purpose plant (Calder Hall) in 1956. The Soviet Union, via Dr.
Ivan Kurchatov,
[explained](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015003413971&view=1up&seq=8) that
they would have 2,500 MWe of nuclear capacity by 1960, with developments ongoing in the
following reactor types:

- Water-moderated and cooled thermal and epithermal 200 MW reactors
- Graphite-moderated steam and water-cooled reactors of the type used at the existing 5 MW
  USSR station
- A heterogeneous heavy water-moderated, gas-cooled reactor
- A unit with water-moderated thermal reactor and a turbine operated by slightly
  radioactive stream fed directly from the reactor
- A homogeneous heavy-water moderated thermal breeder with thorium fuel
- A thermal graphite-moderated sodium-cooled reactor
- A fast sodium-cooled breeder on the U-Pu fuel cycle

(Recall that _heavy water_, also called D<sub>2</sub>O, is water with the
hydrogen atoms replaced with isotopically-enriched deuterium. It has very low
neutron absorption and is a best-in-class moderator.)

  </div>
</div>

#### The Power Demonstration Reactor Program

The AEC's Power Demonstration Reactor Program (PDRP) kicked off after the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 allowed private ownership and operation of reactors. It involved 3 separate
requests for proposals from private industry wherein the AEC would provide nuclear fuel and
perform research and development work necessary to bring forward commercial nuclear power
plants.

The three invitations between 1955 and 1960 are visible in the figure below, with some
straggling proposals trickling in around 1960. Utility consortiums sent in significant
and bold proposals covering a diverse range of reactor types and sizes including pressurized
and boiling water reactors, an organic cooled/moderated reactor, two nuclear superheat
BWRs, a sodium-cooled fast reactor, and a sodium/graphite intermediate reactor.

### The commercialization of the pressurized water reactor

The positive experiences with the STR and the APPR-1, plus a strong desire to stay ahead
of the Russians and to catch up with the UK resulted in strong support for a large-scale
water-cooled demonstration reactor. At the same time, a troubled aircraft carrier
prototype reactor program was just defunded by Eisenhower. The project was converted to a
commercial power prototype called Shippingport. It would become the USA's first
commercial nuclear power plant.

The initial Shippingport core used highly enriched uranium. High temperature, high-burnup
fuels in water conditions were developed. Metallic uranium fuel in water failed rapidly.
They found promising results when they alloyed uranium with molybdenum, niobium, and both.
Alloys with 3.8% Silicon with intermetallic U<sub>3</sub>Si silicides were also promising
(more recently revived under the name [_Accident Tolerant
Fuels_](https://nei.org/advocacy/make-regulations-smarter/accident-tolerant-fuel)), but a suitable clad
fabrication process with this fuel was elusive. A high-temperature in-pile loop had to be
developed to carry out this alloy development program (at both MTR in Idaho and NRX in
Canada). Troubles with Uranium-Molybdenum cladding were encountered, and high medium-speed
neutron absorption was discovered. Along the way, it was discovered that the ceramic
uranium oxide was surprisingly good as a reactor fuel.

Many lessons were learned in early Shippingport operation. Valves sometimes bounced
between open and closed during the operation of other valves, and valves drifted from
closed to open in certain situations. Pressurizer steam relief valves leaked due to
thermal distortions. Leaks in four steam generators were found, caused by stress
corrosion. Pieces of the turbine moisture separator ended up breaking off and lodging in
the turbine low-pressure blades due to vibrations. Excessive fission products appeared in
the coolant, likely due to defective UO<sub>2</sub> blanket rods.

Despite the trouble, Shippingport was a successfully-operated plant, but its capital cost
was about 10x more than an equivalent fossil-fueled plant. Economical nuclear power was
elusive.

Given the realities of Shippingport, utilities continued in their hesitation. The PWR was
urged toward commercialization by the AEC's public/private PDRP. The Yankee reactor at
Rowe was proposed in the first round of the PDRP by a consortium of 10 New England
utilities, who funded the entire capital cost. It reached full power of 110 MWe in Jan
1961\. Yankee Core I was the first to use UO<sub>2</sub> fuel with stainless steel
cladding. The Yankee experience was very positive from R&D to construction to operation.
They completed the plant 23% below projected capital costs. Now things were looking up.

Indian Point was a 163 MWe PWR that went critical in August 1962 with homogeneously mixed
oxides of highly enriched uranium and thorium. Its purpose was to develop the thorium fuel
cycle for power breeding in order to extend the resources available to PWRs in the event
of a global-scale fleet ramp-up. The benefits of thorium fuel proved elusive, and so the
second core was low-enriched UO<sub>2</sub> with no thorium.

Also in 1962, the small 20 MWt Saxton PWR "hook-on" reactor became critical in
Pennsylvania. It added nuclear-generated steam to an existing fossil-powered turbine.

San Onofre and Connecticut Yankee came online in 1968, and then somewhat of
a deluge of orders became the majority of today's nuclear fleet.

PWRs for civilian nuclear-powered shipping were also developed.
A land-based prototype for the _NS Savannah_ merchant ship's core was built and
operated in Lynchburg, VA in February, 1960. This reactor had full-length fuel
assemblies and provided information needed before finishing the NS Savannah
plant. Side-note: [we got a whole documentary about Savannah scanned.]({% link
_posts/2023-07-12-the-nuclear-ship-savannah-film-digitized.md %})

<div class="alert

international shipping. However, the [one such operating
vessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevmorput) is basically forbidden from most
international ports. So either hearts and minds would have to be wholesale changed, or
some kind of nuclear-powered deep-sea tugboat/barge system is needed to progress in this
idea.
</div>

On the military side, dozens of land-based prototypes of new naval PWRs have been
built, along with hundreds of their deployed at-sea counterparts (mostly
in subs and aircraft carriers, but also in a few Destroyers).

Many variations on the PWR, like the thorium-fueled spectral shift control PWR
were studied but didn't break through.

The N-reactor at the Hanford site was a dual-purpose water and graphite
moderated variation on a PWR used to make power for the area as well as weapons materials.
This was a somewhat significant deviation from the low-temperature earlier production
reactors.

As cost dynamics pressured PWRs in the 1970s, simpler and more economical
designs were developed. France chose a standard PWR and built them in bulk.
South Korea also developed highly-optimized PWRs based on CE designs. This will
be covered in a follow-up article.

### The development of the boiling water reactor

With the PWR developed for naval propulsion, the Argonne National Lab (ANL) set forth to
develop a simpler and cheaper water-cooled reactor intended specifically for power
production. The Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) avoided the 2000 psi pressure, reduced the
required pumping power, and eliminated the costs and complications of intermediate heat
exchangers (i.e. the steam generators). For the most part, it was able to leverage the
materials and fuel work already done for PWRs.

Boiling water in a reactor was mentioned on the front page of the New York Times in 1939.
Early concerns about whether a reactor with boiling in the core would be stable were
investigated in lab tests of heat transfer in boiling water at the ANL. After
calculations suggested stability was possible, Argonne performed a series of BOiling water
ReActor eXperiments (BORAX) with real chain reactions at the NRTS in Idaho to prove it.

BORAX-1 was built by the AEC in a hole in the ground. It proved that BWRs could be
self-regulating, though it indicated oscillatory "chugging" with 1 second frequencies
given certain large reactivity insertions. A larger experiment, BORAX-2, was built to
ensure stability at higher powers. It was re-designated BORAX-III with the addition of a
turbine, which subsequently powered the entire town of Arco, ID for one hour.

Positive indications in these small experiments motivated the creation of a small but
prototypic reactor called the Experimental Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR) rated at 5 MWe.
R&D plus construction were estimated to cost $17 million.

The EBWR was built at ANL. It was a direct-cycle BWR making saturated steam at 600 psig
(489 °F). A complete, integrated power plant was necessary to answer questions associated
with direct coupling between the reactor and the power generating equipment: uncertainties
in induced radioactivity, reactivity feedback, corrosion, erosion, leakage, and water
quality control. The EBWR was unusually flexible because it was an experimental plant
intent on providing as much information about future BWR operation as possible. It
accommodated future conversion from light water moderator with natural circulation cooling
to forced circulation and heavy water moderation.

General Electric rallied hard for the 1954 changes to the Atomic Energy Act allowing
private ownership and operation of nuclear facilities. Before it passed, they had
three nuclear departments: operating the Hanford production reactors, doing submarine
testing at KAPL, and working on the aircraft nuclear propulsion project. They also
contributed significantly during the Manhattan Project. After the 1954 act, they added a
fourth nuclear division: an atomic power equipment department.

At this time, General Electric (GE) boldly took on a contract to build what became the
large-scale Dresden BWR. They started performing vast amounts of commercial nuclear R&D on
their own dime because they were convinced at this time that commercial nuclear was going
to be big business. Regarding the proposed large-scale Dresden BWR, GE's VP McCune said
in 1956 that:

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start">
<p>
I have already testified that the developmental work required to produce this plant,
particularly fuel element development, will be very expensive. Unless we obtain
substantial future business, we will lose considerable sums on the Dresden station. At
the time we contracted to build this plant for Commonwealth, we were well aware of this.
We are aware also of the difficult technical problems ahead of us and of the large
investments in developmental facilities, these very expensive tools of the trade, which
would be required.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, when we signed the Commonwealth contract, we faced serious problems in
addition to the technical ones. The regulatory and licensing situation was still
unsettled. The Commission was just beginning to break down the information barriers.
Above all, the liability problem had not been resolved. 
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, we took on the Dresden station because we were convinced that by doing so
we would serve the long-run interests of our share owners, our responsibilities to the
system of private enterprise, and the national interest. Our decision to go forward was
also based on the belief that Congress expected this kind of a job to be done by private
industry. We had faith that Congress, and particularly this committee, as well as the
Commission, wanted to encourage private development and would take all reasonable steps
to promote that development.
</p>

Soon, GE enlisted services of their steam turbine-generator department for the plant
design, their induction motor department for special motors, their carboloy department for
fuel development, their general engineering lab for instrumentation, and their R&D
capabilities, also for fuel development. They created the 1,600-acre Vallecitos Atomic
Laboratory in California to be their component testing grounds, with a hot lab and an
experimental physics building containing a critical experiment facility. They went so far as to
build the Vallecitos BWR (VBWR) on the site with 100% private capital to help GE staff
gain the knowledge and experience necessary to deliver on the large-scale Dresden BWR
project. It was about the same size as the AEC's EBWR (Senator Anderson even prodded
McCune about what they'd learn at VBWR that wasn't learned at EBWR), but featured a dual
cycle, where steam could be generated from the stream drum or from a lower-pressure steam
generator. This was expected to improve load-following capabilities. It was also higher
pressure: 1000 psia instead of 600.

As Dresden was being designed, GE had 2,250 scientists and engineers in their four nuclear
departments.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Given their experience operating the Hanford production reactors, GE spent a lot of their
own money exploring the design of a graphite-moderated electricity-producing plant. They also
looked hard into homogeneous reactors. But, when the time came, they decided that the BWR
design was the most promising, and they leapt in full-force with the Dresden contract.
Specifically, Dr. Walter Zinn's confidence in the ANL-designed BWR is what convinced GE to
go for it rather than the homogeneous reactor.
</div>

Dresden featured a dual-cycle steam system, and produced power in April, 1960. The
plant operated well. After Dresden came Humboldt Bay with natural circulation.

There was one tragedy along the BWR development pathway. The Army's SL-1 in Idaho was part
of the Army Package Power Program, previously called the Argonne Low Power Reactor, ALPR.
It was designed to be built on the tundra above [the DEW
line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_Early_Warning_Line) to power radar stations.
It suffered an explosion on January 3, 1961 that resulted in 3 casualties. SL-1 was a
small, natural circulation, direct cycle BWR designed and built by ANL. ANL directed the
project, and Pioneer Service & Engineering Company was the A/E. Operation was turned over
to Combustion Engineering after the plant was operational.

Before the accident, the reactor had been shutdown and the night-shift workers were
preparing for a power ascent. The procedure required them to lift the inserted central
control rod about 4 inches to hook it back to the drive mechanisms. For a reason that will
forever be unknown, the worker lifted the rod quickly by 20 inches. A prompt-supercritical
(e.g. very fast) chain reaction ensued, vaporizing and expanding fuel before the water had
time to boil and add its negative feedback component. After the core was at very high
power (around 20 gigawatts), the vaporizing fuel elements vaporized and rapidly boiled the
water. The steam accelerated the seven-foot column of water above the core, slamming it
into the lid of the pressure vessel at 160 feet per second, forming a massive water
hammer. The shield plugs ejected at up to 50 feet per second, along with much of the
shielding. The three military personnel who were on
top of the reactor head at the time suffered fatal and gruesome injuries (one was pinned
to the roof through the groin by an ejected moderator assembly). The creation of 10,000
psi pressure from the water hammer within the sealed pressure vessel had not been expected.
Had the vessel featured an open top, for example, the most destructive effects would not have
occurred. It became an important lesson to never put reactors into such a configuration.

Analysis showed that the control rod was pulled with less than full force. Some have gone
so far as to hypothesize that a love triangle was involved, and that this accident was a
murder-suicide by nuclear chain reaction. (This seems very unlikely). In any case, a
cleanup ensued and the site is now barely noticeable as you drive through the Idaho
sagebrush.

Big Rock Point in Charlevoix, MI (critical on September 27, 1962) first conducted a 4.5
years AEC research program demonstrating [high power density
cores](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015086420539&view=1up&seq=31) that had
been tested in VBWR. Obtaining more power out of a volume would possibly allow smaller
pressure vessels and uprates at existing plants. After the tests, the plant switched over
to producing commercial power for the region, which coincidentally is where I spent my
childhood. I grew up about 10 miles from Big Rock, which operated well until my teens.

Elk River was another small "hook-on" reactor that added steam to an
existing conventional plant. It was a BWR though, and a part of the PDRP. Its criticality
was 2 years behind schedule. Steel strikes and other strikes delayed the project, as well
as hairline cracks discovered in the cladding inside the pressure vessel. Repairs were
made and authorization to operate was given. It was coupled to a coal-fired superheater.

In 1964, GE sold the Oyster Creek reactor to Jersey Central Light at a guaranteed fixed
capital cost that was competitive with fossil fuels. Widespread euphoria spread throughout the
nuclear developers. At a State of the Lab speech, Alvin Weinberg shouted:

<blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic">Economic nuclear power is here!</blockquote>

Between 1963 and 1966, 10 utilities purchase 12 PWRs and BWRs from GE and Westinghouse
under these turnkey contracts.

Alas, the turnkey era was short lived. The reactor vendors struggled to make money on
these sales. Coal executives claimed that GE had priced Oyster Creek below cost. GE denied this,
saying they'd make a small profit unless unforeseen difficulties were encountered. The plants
were still large, complex, and expensive. Increasing public scrutiny and the associated
regulatory instability caused various cost escalations.

Today, multiple PWRs have had to shut down prematurely due to intractable steam generator
problems. This at least partially validates the major BWR advantage of having a direct
primary cooling loop.

Advanced-model BWRs were developed in more recent years, focusing on simplicity and economics.

### The Hallam sodium-graphite reactor in Nebraska

Ok, you may have been aware of the developments so far, but let's now dip into some of the
more exotic developments of the days gone by.

Liquid metal is an excellent coolant fluid, enabling low-pressure operation, phenomenal
heat transfer, and thrillingly little corrosion. It was used in the EBR-I fast-neutron
reactor in 1951. Since fast-neutron reactors require far more fissile material to start
up, a [sodium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor]({%
link sodium-graphite-reactors.md %}) was envisioned as a potential candidate
for producing low-cost nuclear electricity. This would allow low-pressure operation
without all the expensive and thick pressure containment systems and backup cooling while
also allowing the reactor to run on natural or very-slightly enriched fuel.

On the downside, many liquid metals are chemically reactive with water, air, and concrete,
and the complications related to inerting the environment and dealing with leaks and fires
would have to be weighed against the aforementioned benefits. Additionally, sodium becomes
highly radioactive as it passed through a nuclear core. The combination of radioactivity
with chemical reactivity necessitates an additional intermediate heat transfer loop,
especially when a metal-water steam generator is used. The extra loop comes expensive
additional equipment: pumps, valves, instrumentation, controls, heaters, and piping.

North American Aviation contributed $2.5M to the $10M cost of research, development,
and construction of the 20 MWt Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) at Santa Susana, CA.

Heavily informed by the AEC's S1G submarine prototype reactor in New York and the [Sodium
Reactor Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_Reactor_Experiment) north of LA,
the [Hallam Nuclear Power
Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallam_Nuclear_Generating_Station) was a 75 MWe
attempt to approach commercial viability of a sodium-graphite reactor. It was proposed in
the first round of the PDRP.

The component testing and R&D in advance of Hallam operation was astounding. In spite of
experience acquired at from the smaller SRE, Atomics International still knew they
needed to build much of the equipment at the larger scale in order to shake down the
scaled-up designs. For example, they built an entire [mockup fuel handling facility and a
full-scale fuel handling
machine](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015095005693&view=1up&seq=1) and
operated it at temperature, in sodium! This allowed them to fix scaling design issues as
well as to practice the various fuel handling activities that would be required in the
operation of the plant.

The Hallam facility was built relatively quickly but struggled with reactor problems
during the shakedown period. After many repairs and lessons, the issue of rupturing
moderator cladding and subsequent over-expansion and closing-off of coolant channels was
the final straw. Consumers Public Power District chose to not purchase the facility from
the AEC, and it was grouted in place by 1969.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
<span class="badge bg-success">Interesting thought</span> 
Since Hallam operated, vast amounts of experience have been gained in sodium-cooled
fast-neutron reactors. It's curious to wonder if a sodium-graphite reactor with that
expanded knowledge-base wouldn't perform significantly better than Hallam did. Then again,
some of the world's newfound sodium experience (e.g. Monju, SuperPhénix) has not been
positive.

### Organic cooled/moderated reactors: Piqua in Ohio

The second solicitation for the PDRP specifically sought small reactors. The Piqua
proposal fit the bill, at just 11.4 MWe. It featured organic coolant and moderator made of
terphenyl isomers (hydrocarbons). It was supposed that organic coolant
would lead to low capital costs. The low vapor pressure of the coolant allowed
low-pressure operation at high temperatures, reducing the weight and bulk of the pressure
vessel while increasing the thermal efficiency. Organic coolant also has low corrosion,
allowing conventional materials like carbon and low-alloy steel to be used rather than
stainless steel in the pressure vessel, pumps, pipes, etc. Lastly, induced radioactivity
in pure organic liquids is very low, unlike in the liquid metals.

The price to pay for the benefits of organic coolant comes in the form of decomposition
cleanup and purification systems. Radiation and heat both cause the fluid to break down
into water vapor, hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons. Also, the heat transfer
characteristics are generally worse than for water, requiring high surface area
fuel element design.

The AEC contracted Atomics International (AI) to do research and development at the
[Organic Moderated Reactor
Experiment](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015095000009&view=1up&seq=233) (OMRE) in
Idaho. This established the basic feasibility of organic-cooled reactors, and allowed AI
to build experience in the system. They measured coolant properties, fabricated fuel,
built and operated the reactor, measured heat transfer, operated purification systems,
built control rod test towers, built a hot cell to examine irradiated fuel, and performed
dozens of other R&D tasks.

As a follow-up to OMRE, the AEC contracted AI to build the Experimental Organic Cooled
Reactor (EOCR), also at the NRTS. This facility was built to 99% completion by the
contractor, but ended up never operating.

The OMRE established the organic-cooled concept sufficiently to motivate the Piqua team to
submit a proposal for a commercial plant.

The business plan for Piqua was that the AEC would own and operate the plant for 5 years,
selling steam to the city for the same price of conventional fossil-fueled steam. After 5
years, the city would have an option to purchase the plant from the AEC. Given their
experience from the OMRE, Atomics International was again contracted to design and build
the Piqua plant.

Piqua was brought to criticality on June, 1963, and reached full power in January 1964.
The plant produced 20% of Piqua's power in 1965, and the city proudly referred to itself
as _The Atomic City_.

In 1966, two control rods were found to not move freely in their guide tubes, and four fuel
elements required abnormally high forces to unseat and would not reseat. The obstruction
was found to be a carbonaceous deposit. Fuel was shipped to Atomics International for hot
cell examination, where a hard continuous film was found on the surface, patches of film
were found on the tips of the cladding film, and the inner moderator space was found to be
full of carbonaceous material. A three-phase core disassembly/rehab program was developed.

As the rehab was ongoing, it became clear that Milton Shaw, the director of Reactor
Development at the AEC, had given up on the organic concept:

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start" markdown="1">
There is an expression used around our office about reactor projects. It is not 
those that have the slow death that worries us; **it is those that have a life after 
death**.
</blockquote>
</figure>

He concluded that the AEC would support the Piqua facility but would otherwise discontinue
all work on the organic cooled concept. The writing was on the wall. In the [FY1969
authorization hearings of the
AEC](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d03584657j&view=1up&seq=481), the
announcement to terminate the Piqua contract was made:

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start" markdown="1">
The Commission is in the process of terminating the operating contract for the Piqua
reactor project.  Several factors entered into this decision including: an increasing need
for available resources (manpower and funding) by higher priority programs; little
programmatic interest since support for organic cooled and moderated reactors and the
HWOCR concept has been phased out; the technical problems which continue to delay
reoperation of the plant and the unlikelihood of the City to purchase the plant.

### Direct nuclear superheat in Puerto Rico and South Dakota

As part of the PDRP, the nuclear industry embarked on a significant research
program into the concept of direct nuclear superheat reactors, or _steam-cooled_ reactors. These
had a boiler region in the core where water is boiled, and then the resulting steam is
passed through the reactor (or in some cases, a separate reactor) a second time in a
superheating core region (typically with a much different cooling channel design). By
superheating the steam to above 500 °C, the overall heat-to-electricity conversion could
be far more efficient, turbine designs could be simpler and more similar to fossil
counterparts (dry steam only), and the cost of the condensing portion of the plant could
be reduced. As mentioned, some previous reactors used fossil plants to do the superheating
before going to the turbine. This direct nuclear superheat concept would have eliminated
that need.

Dozens of nuclear superheat reactors were designed to conceptual levels (supporting
initial cost estimation) and at least four were built and operated: Borax-5 in Idaho,
Pathfinder in Sioux Falls, SD, BONUS in Rincón, Puerto Rico, and the Empire State Atomic
Development Agency Vallecitos Experimental Superheat Reactor (EVESR) near San Francisco
(which was actually an add-on reactor that you bolt to the outlet of your normal BWR).

The key technical challenges for nuclear superheat has been reliable fuel elements at high

Nuclear superheat reactors mostly operated pathetically due to high-temperature
complications (corrosion, erosion). Nothing has been done on them since the 1960s (except
maybe in Russia). [Some say](http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2014/06/13/pathfinder/) the concept
of direct superheat reactors is definitively dead due to these negative experiences.
However, advances in materials since then may eventually warrant another look. The
direct-cycle simplicity of a BWR plus the added efficiency of superheated steam could cut
costs in "normal"-looking reactors by a notable
amount.

### Gas-cooled reactors

Gas coolant is generally transparent to neutrons and can reach very high temperatures, but
has generally poor heat transfer characteristics must be held and pumped at high pressure.
Converting heat to electricity with a gas-cooled reactor requires fuels that can handle
very high temperatures. Gasses that have been used to cool reactors include air (bad idea
when graphite is involved because of potential fires, as learned at Windscale), helium
(relatively expensive), CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

The Heat Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE, pronounced "heater") made at the NRTS during
the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program had air coolant, water/ZrH moderator. Some studies
were made to understand the options to convert this reactor concept into a merchant ship
nuclear steam generator concept, called the 630A. The HTRE-3 at one point was on automatic control and automatically
withdrew a control rod due to a faulty flux sensor, causing a power excursion and meltdown.
HTRE-1/2 and 3 are in the EBR-I museum parking lot (in Idaho) for anyone to visit to this day.

The AEC built the Gas-Cooled Reactor Experiment (GCRE) with nitrogen cooling at the NRTS
to support the Army's ANPP, specifically for mobile, truck-mounted reactors (ML-1).

</figure>

The success in the UK in graphite-moderated, CO<sub>2</sub>-cooled, dual-purpose MAGNOX
reactors caused the AEC's Congressional oversight committee JCAE (particularly the
executive directory, James Ramsey) to hound the AEC to look into those kinds of reactors
for large power stations as well, so as to not have all the power-station eggs in the PWR
basket. In 1956, they directed the AEC to build such a plant. The 30 MWe helium-cooled
Experimental Gas-Cooled Reactor (EGCR) was designed and built by H. K. Ferguson and Kaiser
Engineering, neither of whom had experience with this kind of reactor. TVA would own and
operate the plant. ORNL was assigned as the technical advisor. It used 3% enriched uranium
oxide and stainless-steel clad.

A huge experimental loop was added to the Oak Ridge Research Reactor that contained
high-pressure helium. They designed and tested the fuel, blowers, valves, and controls.
Because the idea came from the top, the development team had very little emotional commitment to the
EGCR. Costs skyrocketed when the plant was half-finished. Just before fuel was to be
loaded, in 1966, the AEC announced that there was no future for gas-cooled reactors in the
USA, and the EGCR project was cancelled.

The Experimental Beryllium-Oxide Reactor (EBOR) was partially constructed at NRTS but
never completed. Its cancellation was announced in the 1966 AEC Annual report to focus
resources on reactors considered likely to deliver economic power. It has also been said
that graphite development was progressing sufficiently that the development of beryllium
moderator was not considered necessary. The experiment was designed by General Atomic
Division of General Atomics.

The High Temperature Marine Propulsion Reactor was a low-power critical experiment that
operated at the NRTS with intent to develop a marine propulsion gas-cooled reactor, but
shut down in 1962.

The KIWI-test series involved graphite loaded with HEU to test Project Rover, a nuclear
rocket. They all used gaseous hydrogen propellant. At this time, Westinghouse had
something called the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory. Related, some critical
experiments for the nuclear ramjet (Project Pluto) were tested at the Nevada Test Site
around December, 1960.

Los Alamos developed the TURRET reactor concept, which was a rotating
cylindrical core mounted on an axis. Gas coolant (originally nitrogen) entered
on the axis and exited through radial holes drilled between the axis and the
periphery. After the end of Project Rover, LANL ran a helium-cooled
manifestation of TURRET, called [UHTREX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHTREX).
It was a gas-cooled experiment to try to apply what they had learned for rockets
to economical nuclear power. The reactor experiment was made of elemental
carbon, had UC₂ fuel coated with 3 layers of pyrolitic carbon formed into unclad
annular tubes, reached coolant temperatures of 2400 °F, and had remote online
refueling using a rotating fuel loader. It ran from 1959-1971 in New Mexico.

It was a promising concept, but yet again, along
came **Milton Shaw** and pulled funding from it to divert it to cover the
over-budget liquid-metal fast breeder reactor project.

A helium-cooled, graphite-moderated, highly-enriched uranium fueled reactor called the
High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) was a power prototype reactor built by General
Dynamics for ESADA (NY) at Peach Bottom. It featured uranium and thorium carbides
dispersed in a graphite matrix, contained in graphite cladding sleeves. Steam was intended
to be produced at 1000 °F and 1450 psi. Construction was completed in late 1964.

Peach Bottom begot Fort St. Vrain (FSV) in Colorado, with detailed design beginning in
1966\. Where Peach Bottom had a steel pressure vessel, FSV had a pre-stressed concrete one.
PB used electrical circulators and multi-pass steam generators, while FSV used
steam-driven circulators and once-through steam generators. At this point, General Atomics
(GA) was a division of General Dynamics. Fuel, physics, and component development was
performed at the Oak Ridge Research Reactor and at the Engineering Test Reactor at the
NRTS.

GA built a prestressed concrete reactor vessel (PCRV) to test under simulated accident
conditions in San Diego. A full-scale prototype steam-driven helium circulator was tested
in 1967 as well.

### Tube reactors

The Carolinas-Virginia Tube Reactor (CVTR, also known as Parr Shoals Station) was a pretty
interesting reactor that operated in Parr Shoals, S. Carolina. It was heavy-water cooled
and moderated and is related to the Canadian CANDU design. The heavy-water coolant
traveled through U-tube pressure tubes to headers on one side of the core. Stagnant
heavy-water baffles inside the pressure tubes prevented heat from escaping to the cold
heavy-water moderator tank (i.e. the calandria). It used low-enriched UO<sub>2</sub> fuel
and had Zircaloy pressure tubes. It was designed and built by Westinghouse with Stone &
Webster as the A/E in a third-round PDRP proposal. It went critical in March, 1963. The
hope of the CVTR reactor was to reduce fuel-cycle costs by enabling fueling with natural
uranium. Though the CVTR itself needed enrichment due to its small size, the excellent
moderation properties of heavy water would allow reduced enrichment operation, and no
enrichment for large versions of the plant. Notably, the charter of the project
explicitly said that it should target natural uranium fuel only in the event that this
turns out to be the cheapest option as the design evolves.

<figcaption>The CVTR was on an interesting site with a hydro plant, a fossil plant, and a nuclear plant all capable of producing power at the same time. This was thought to be unique in the world.

</figure>

Interesting control mechanisms were considered for CVTR, including shim control by
adjusting the moderator temperature, or chemical shim in the moderator.

Another tube reactor PDRP proposal is worth mentioning (it could also fit in the
gas-cooled reactor section): the brilliantly-named East Central Nuclear Group - Florida
West Coast Nuclear Group (ECNG-FWCNG) D<sub>2</sub>O-moderated, CO<sub>2</sub>-cooled,
pressure-tube reactor. The utility group was located where coal was cheapest, so they
spent over a year studying reactor concepts to choose the one with the most potential to
produce economic power. They sought low fuel cost, no limit in unit capacity, and high
thermal efficiency. This reactor concept could run on natural uranium. They executed an
R&D period in preparation for a 50 MWe prototype of a 200 MWe full-scale plant.

General Nuclear Engineering Corporation performed much of the engineering and development
for the ECNG reactor. They figured they could run at 500 psig coolant pressure and achieve
4 MWd/kg burnup before fission products stop the reaction.

A heat transfer loop was built and operated to test the pressurized CO<sub>2</sub> coolant with
electrical heating and instrumentation. Two high-temperature corrosion loops were built.
Test plans for tube liners, bellows, seal joints, fluid flow, tube seals, burst tests, and
an in-pile loop test were all planned.

### The Sodium-Deuterium Reactor Program

The sodium-deuterium reactor (SDR) program was sponsored by the AEC under the second
round PDRP proposal by Chugach Electric Association in 1956. The project targeted thermal
efficiency and neutron economy, combining the phenomenal low-pressure coolant properties
of sodium metal with the phenomenal neutron moderation properties of heavy water. The key
challenge, of course, was sodium-water isolation.

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start">
The principal problem in the SDR is a psychological one. Many people have a feeling that
sodium and water react explosively; they do not react explosively. Hydrogen and oxygen
do react explosively. The pyrotechnics that you may have seen on sodium combining with
H<sub>2</sub>O is principally one in which hydrogen has reacted with oxygen in the air. The
reaction rate is of the order of microseconds; it is truly an explosive reaction.
Sodium and water can be handled quite safely and quite easily, as I will show you later.

The SDR program, for better or for worse, never made it out of component testing.

### Liquid Metal-cooled Fast Breeder Reactors

Recall that the AEC built the very small experimental breeder reactor (EBR-1), also called
Zinn's Infernal Pile, as part of its first set of reactors in the late 1940s. This reactor
proved the physical viability of the concept of breeding, or generating more fissile
material than you consume. EBR-1 succeeded in its mission (and is now a phenomenal museum
near Arco, Idaho). A much larger reactor of this type, the EBR-II, was authorized under
the 5-year plan, originally set to be complete in 1958 but delayed until 1964.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<b>Enough uranium?</b> In the mid 1940s, reactor designers were concerned that
insufficient uranium existed on Earth to produce significant amounts of power
(<a href="https://technicalreports.ornl.gov/1944/3445605715063.pdf">ref</a>). By
the 1950s, this was no longer a concern, and economics was given top priority.
Breeder development was deprioritized until the mid-1960s, when LWR tech was
looking fully-developed, order books were filling up, energy demand projections
were exponential, and global uranium supply became a question
again.
</div>

The first round of the PDRP did feature a proposal to build [the Fermi-1 sodium-cooled
fast reactor near
Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi_Nuclear_Generating_Station#Fermi_1).
This plant was built with many delays but did operate. It suffered a partial melt-down and
was refurbished and operated again, always with numerous operational problems. It is
likely that sodium technology was not at the demonstration stage when Fermi was proposed,
and its mediocre operation was the result.

In 1966, [the AEC announced that they'd be prioritizing the high-gain sodium-cooled
breeder
program](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001309528&view=1up&seq=173) and
keeping low-gain breeders like the light-water breeder and the molten salt breeder on
life support. Other non-breeders would be deprioritized. This was a fateful moment for
nuclear development.

In 1966, the AEC stated:

<figure>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-start">
The Nation's extensive industrial capabilities and resources are being brought to bear
heavily on the LMFBR development program.
</blockquote>
</figure>

The technical study areas were defined and systematically pushed forward: fuels and
materials, reprocessing and recycling, physics, nuclear safety, sodium technology,
component development, instrumentation and control, and plant design. Facilities and
irradiation capabilities were ramped up to develop stainless, nickel-base, and refractory
alloys for LMFBR environments. The ATR and FFTF test reactors were developed to support the
program. Multiple large new physics facilities, including the ZPPR in Idaho and the SEFOR
in Arkansas provided fast-reactor physics data.

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header text-white bg-success"><strong>Fast vs. thermal neutrons</strong></div>
  <div class="card-body" markdown="1">
Neutrons emerge from a splitting nucleus at about 10,000 miles per second.  They are
generally slowed down to a few miles per second by a *[moderator]({% link moderation.md
%})* to minimize the amount of fissile fuel required. Once slowed down, they are called
*thermal* neutrons indicating that they are at equilibrium with the thermal agitation of
the atoms or molecules at the temperature of the materials in the reactor.

[*Fast* reactors]({% link fast-reactor.md %}) don't have moderators: they're just fuel, coolant, and structure. They
require more fissile material (like <sup>235</sup>U) to achieve a chain reaction, but in
return generate far more excess neutrons, allowing for extra fertile material to be loaded
for efficient breeding.

  </div>
</div>

Small sodium components (steam generators, pumps, valves, heat exchangers) were in
operation from EBR-II, SRE, Hallam, and Fermi-1, but the large components for the LMFBR
differed greatly. The industrial designers and fabricators were tasked with very high
standards, and had to perform positive verification of their performance in realistic
proof-tests before components were installed in an expensive large plant. The AEC established a
Liquid Metal Engineering Center at Santa Susana with Atomics International contracting.
Facilities at the center included the Sodium Components Test Installation, the Control Rod
Test Tower, Large Component Test Loop, and Sodium Pump Test Facility, and a Liquid Metals
Information Center.

Actually, that's just the beginning of the test facilities. The [Facility Table in the
1968 AEC LMFBR
program](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015095219435&view=1up&seq=82)
enlisted the services of **4 fast reactors, 12 fast reactor loops, 3 thermal reactor
loops, 5 pulsed reactors, 1 pulsed reactor loop, 14 hot cell facilities with plutonium
capability, 13 hot cells for cladding, 44 non-nuclear sodium test facilities, 29
non-sodium hydraulic test facilities, 13 critical assemblies, 6 accelerators, 2 fuel
processing pilot plants, and 1 fuel fabrication pilot plant**. The task list in there is
equally massive. This development program was absolutely gigantic.

The target plant was the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant (CRBRP). The program developed
very much technology but eventually was cancelled, first in the late 1970s and then
forever in the early 1980s. France, Germany, Russia, Japan, India, and China have also
performed fast-reactor development programs. As of early 2020, only Russia has large SFRs
producing commercial power.

### Homogeneous Reactors

Another approach to economical nuclear power was the homogeneous reactor
design, which uses flowing fluid that contains nuclear fuel. Expected
advantages included simplicity of construction, ease of chemical processing
(since the fuel is liquid already), and elimination of fuel fabrication.

This concept was first explored during the war in LANL's "water boiler" reactors, LOPO and
SUPO. These were followed by the Los Alamos Power Reactor Experiments (LAPRE I and II),
which tested the viability of small fluid fueled reactors using high-pressure uranyl
phosphate solution fuel with highly-enriched uranium. They would have made 10-50 MWe
compact reactors, likely to be used by the military for remote power.

LANL also ran LAMPRE-1, which featured molten metal fuel encapsulated in tantalum tubes.

Oak Ridge built the 1 MWt Homogeneous Reactor Experiment-1 (HRE-1), fueled
with highly-enriched uranium as uranyl sulfate in an aqueous solution to prove
that a power reactor of this type could operate in a stable manner. In the
5-year plan, ORNL and Union Carbide built the larger 5-10 MWt HRE-2.

To breed with slow neutrons, you have to use the thorium fuel cycle. It was anticipated
that HRE-2 would be modified after initial operation to accommodate thorium oxide slurry
runs.

After the HRE-2 troubles, the concept of a homogeneous thorium-based thermal breeder
evolved. By 1960, the billion-dollar Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program had produced vast
technical data on high-temperature molten salts that can dissolve uranium and thorium at
sufficient concentrations to operate a reactor. During the ANP, the 2.5 MW [Aircraft
Reactor Experiment (ARE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment) was
the first [molten-salt reactor (MSR)]({% link msr.md %}) to operate (crazily, it was
sodium metal and molten salt-cooled with both circuits dumping heat via helium
intermediates to water). Alvin Weinberg and the ORNL team turned their attention to
molten-salt reactors for power. This culminated in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE), a 8 MWt experiment that ran very well.

A follow-up demonstration reactor was planned (the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor),
but like the organic reactor before it, **Milton Shaw** effectively pulled the plug
on the homogeneous reactor development as part of the effort to concentrate
budget and resources on the fast-neutron breeder development.

To this very day, many people lament the abandonment of this promising reactor technology.
The molten-salt reactors have become most strongly associated with Thorium, which has
attained almost [mythological status]({% link thorium-myths.md %}) among nuclear proponents.
Many of the nuclear power startup companies today are focused on bringing MSR development
back online.

Fortunately, the ORNL MSR team [wrote down exactly where they were and where to
pick the effort back up](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/4227904), specifically
hoping some future people would do so. I always recommend new MSR companies
read and understand that document in detail first (e.g. have the CTO spend a few
months with it). The MSRE Design and Operations is also [very well
documented](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/4654707).

## Conclusions

I love reading and learning about past reactor developments. I'm in awe of what was
accomplished. I desperately want to pick up in places where the USA left off and push
forward in a modern context.

Still, it's abundantly clear that developing new kinds of reactors for commoditized
purposes is a grueling challenge, not for the faint of heart. An old-timer once
whispered to me at a comically over-optimistic talk at a conference:

<blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic">
Nick, you see, these guys just haven't been run over by the nuclear bus yet!
</blockquote>

The more we study and understand the nuclear bus, the more likely we'll be able to prepare
for and leverage it when it comes in our future reactor developments. We must not fear the
nuclear bus. We also must not pretend it isn't out there lurking.

### The rest of the story

The LWR fleet that took off after Shippingport and Yankee Rowe ran into economic troubles
due to retrofits after various operational occurrences in the 1970s but pulled through by
dramatically improving operation (capacity factors increased to above 90%). Today, new
economic struggles challenge the fleet. The [major cost drivers of nuclear are now
understood]({% link economics.md %}), and we know we must standardize designs and engage
in serial production to proceed.

### A few observations

- As the small and/or exotic (i.e. _advanced_) reactors struggled (Fermi-1, Hallam, Piqua,
  Pathfinder, HRE-2), the non-superheat LWRs (Yankee Rowe, Dresden) performed very well.
  Their excellent, stable performance is the fundamental reason they came to dominance. This
  doesn't mean LWRs are the end-all/be-all (they aren't!), but it sets a very high bar for
  program success.

- Many major efforts in reactor development struggled and then failed due to unexpected
  technical challenges that arose not at the study, lab, or reactor experiment phases, but
  rather at the prototype stage or even after the first commercial reactor was operated.
  We see yet again what all the legendary nuclear icons have told us all along: in nuclear,
  he who is putting on his armor should not boast as he who is taking his off. Nuclear
  progress requires good and dedicated engineering, not an instant miracle-cure.

- Most reactor developments that got shut down thought they needed 5-10 years more
  development to succeed but were unable to inspire the funding for it. Very few
  reactor concepts have been definitively proven as bad ideas with no hope.

- Very large, very experienced firms with military contracting experience and
  large R&D budgets developed nuclear reactor technology and heavily leveraged
  thousands of in-house scientists, engineers, support, and facilities to do so.
  Reengaging this magnitude of industrial capacity is not easy or cheap.

- Pairing new nuclear tech development with small, low-budget utility operators may not be
  a good combination.

- Although it may cause old Milton Shaw to roll in his grave, Some of the reactor ideas tried in
  the past may be worth reconsidering due to material and fuel advances since then.

- The quest for economical nuclear power in commoditized markets has been worked on
  across the decades. **Thousands upon thousands of pages** are freely available
  for everyone to read describing their efforts and lessons, particularly on HathiTrust
  and OSTI. Perhaps surprisingly, _much of the information is still relevant today!_

- Component testing and development is much more significant than many modern nuclear
  developers might expect.

- Nuclear developers of the past were not in any sense paralyzed by a lack of
  computational power. They ran critical experiments instead of high-fidelity neutronics
  and used scale model flow visualizations instead of CFD. Modern computer tools make these
  things easier and cheaper (e.g. they can largely replace many critical assemblies and
  physical models), but don't unlock any doors to new reactor technology. The
  biggest impact computers can have may be in information management and automation to efficiently deal
  with complexity.

- The challenge in new reactor development is not in the intellectual property surrounding the
  reactor's mode of operation, but rather delivery on the progression from reactor
  experiment to commercial fleet. Reactor _ideas_ are a dime a dozen. We should focus on
  improving this progression.

- Reactor experiments are a good way to re-bootstrap nuclear innovation, but let's not
  forget that there's a long way between a reactor experiment and a commercial fleet.

- Milton Shaw shut down at least 3 somewhat promising reactor development programs to
  make room for the LMFBR program.

- A consortium of multiple utilities banding together to purchase and operate the first
  commercial unit of any new-tech reactor is a heck of a good idea after demonstration,
  and has positive historical experience.

  <div class="card-body" markdown="1">
It's impressive to note how many *Reactor Experiments* have been run. These are small
chain-reacting machines, usually in remote areas, often without power generating
equipment, that are used to understand the performance  of any new reactors operating
principles. They are made after critical assemblies and before prototype reactors. We have
run over a dozen REs, including the BORAX series, LAPRE-1 and 2, LAMPRE, HTRE-1 through 3,

Nick Touran decided he wanted to help solve the world's energy issues in 2002.
He discovered nuclear engineering as a challenging yet interesting pathway to
accomplish this, and dedicated his career to the challenge. He and his
colleagues started this website to help improve public understanding of nuclear
tech. He studied the design and performance of conventional, sodium-cooled, and
fusion reactors while earning a bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. in nuclear
engineering at the University of Michigan. He moved to Seattle in 2009 to push
the envelope in reactor deployment at a nuclear technology development company
(which is wholly unaffiliated with this website).

He frequently gives public talks and seminars describing the current world
energy situation, nuclear technology in general, and (most recently) the
history of nuclear reactor development. This page was written on vacation as

  interesting in non-US countries where enrichment is not available, but that the prospects
  for D<sub>2</sub>O moderation in a world with enriched uranium is questionable. It is also stated
  that reactors fueled with natural uranium are convenient if an emergency need for

  <div class="card-header text-white bg-success"><strong>Too cheap to meter?</strong></div>
  <div class="card-body" markdown="1">
Modern writing about nuclear economics often includes a statement
to the tune of "once touted as *too cheap to meter*, nuclear is actually expensive". This line 
comes from Lewis Strauss' grandiose [speech at a Science Writers
dinner](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1613/ML16131A120.pdf) in 1954. It was a broad and hopeful
prediction reflecting a general confidence in scientific progress:

> It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical
> energy **too cheap to meter**, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world
> only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and
> through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a
> lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes
> him to age

In reality, very few people at this time were confident that economical nuclear
electricity was possible, much less around the corner.
