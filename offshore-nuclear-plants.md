In 1969, at the height of the First Nuclear Era, an engineer at New Jersey's PSE&G utility
company named Richard Eckert imagined a peculiar model for manufacturing, siting, and
delivering nuclear power plants<sup>3</sup>. New Jersey was anticipating brownouts soon and had to
expand capacity, but suitable sites were all taken. What if, he wondered, huge nuclear
plants could be built in serial at a production facility, put on a barge, and floated
to sites out at sea?

I had heard of Offshore Power Systems and their power plant assembly line before, but
until recently I did not understand how far along they really had gotten.

The idea of Floating Nuclear Power Plants (FNPPs) always sounds a little crazy at first,
as it did to Eckert's wife when he told her of his idea. But given some thought, many
enticing characteristics are revealed. After all, the first power reactors were made
to propel naval submarines, hundreds of which have prowled the seas since 1955. A civilian
nuclear-powered merchant ship (NS _Savannah_) had been built and operated. The US Army's
MH-1A _Sturgis_ nuclear plant on a barge had helped power the Panama Canal for years.

## The proposed Atlantic Generating Station

PSE&G went to work on the idea quickly. They named their first FNPP site the Atlantic
Generating Station, located 2.8 miles off the New Jersey coast. Design work and
environmental studies commenced rapidly.

PSE&G was gambling enough on siting, they wanted to use a tried-and-true reactor design.
They promised to be a customer for Westinghouse PWRs if they could be built on floating
platforms. Westinghouse knew plants, but needed help on the floating side. Thus, Offshore
Power Systems (OPS) was formed on July 6, 1972 as a 50/50 joint venture between Tenneco
Power Systems (who owned the Newport News shipyard) and Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
It proposed to design, manufacture, and market complete nuclear power plants of a
standardized design and integrated with specially designed floating platforms <sup>5</sup>.

src="/img/ops-station.jpg" alt="The full OPS station"/></a>
<div class="caption centered"><p>A full OPS station. The weird shape was designed for the fish.</p></div> </div>

Each floating nuclear power station (FNPS) would contain two or more FNPPs within a
protective breakwater. The individual plants were to be 1150 MWe Westinghouse four-loop
PWRs with ice-condenser containments. They had once-through steam condenser cooling with
no cooling towers. Electricity was to be transmitted at high-voltage (345 kV) through
submerged cables beneath the sea bottom. A shore support facility would provide a staging
area, a docking facility, office buildings, and parking.

International</a>)</p></div> </div>

In lieu of massive concrete foundations, the bulk of the concrete would be in the
breakwater, which required 17,000 concrete dolosse (which resemble child's jacks), with
each dolos weighing between 11 and 62 tons, interlocked into an armor surface to protect
from storm-generated waves and to prevent ships from colliding with the FNPPs. The cassion
sand fill was expected to be sourced from the sea bottom.

</div>
</div>
</div>

The AEC informed OPS of the pre-application review on October 20, 1972, which
concluded that<sup>1</sup>:

> The integration of land-based nuclear power plant technology to the
> platform-mounted nuclear plant concept does not appear to present major
> problems, based on the information presented to day, and that it appears to
> be a feasible concept.

### Environmental studies

Vast environmental studies, hearings, and licensing activities were required. The
environmentalist movement was in full-swing at this point, and so the impact of the
proposed plants on every fish and critter from the Maine coast to the Texas coast was
studied.<sup>3</sup>:

<figure class="text-start">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
Hydrologists were brought in to make thermal studies to establish isotherms for varying
tide and current conditions. Because cables would someday have to come out of the water
and traverse land in order to bring power from the ocean to the people, general
ecologists were commissioned to begin field studies that would eventually consider every
tree, every bird, every animal — literally, every mouse— that might in any way be
disturbed: white footed mouse, meadow jumping mouse, house mouse, pine vole, Norway rat,
short-tailed shrew, least shrew, semi-palmated sandpiper, American widgeon, horned
grebe, Atlantic white cedar, pitch pine, rabbit-foot clover, many hundreds of other
species.
</blockquote>
</figure>

PSE&G contracted Ichthyological Associates, who ended up specifying many design
characteristics of the plant in accordance with their research. The warm water and large
breakwater would attract much life, and the plant had to be designed to minimize harm.

<figure class="text-start">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
There would be more fish and shellfish in that area than in any other square mile in the
Atlantic Ocean
</blockquote>
<figcaption class="blockquote-footer">David Thomas, project director of Marine Ecological Study<sup>3</sup></figcaption>
</figure>

Each FNPP unit would draw 1 million gallons per minute of seawater for cooling and would
increase the water temperature by 17.2 °F in limiting operation. The system featured a
trash bar screen that lifted garbage out of the ocean and put it in a trash dumpster to
prevent trash from entering the reactor. As a side-effect, this plant would actually clean
the oceans!

The oceanographic researchers slowly came to support the project. Eldridge said,<sup>3</sup>:

<figure class="text-start">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
"My first reactions were 'What a hell of a place to put a plant! Can't they
think of a better place than the ocean? Why put a nuclear plant in such a hostile
environment?' But after I got into it I changed my mind. We all did. And everyone in my
group here is a professional environmentalist — not a cocktail environmentalist,
self-appointed. Regulations are nebulous for this site and this concept. The work we do
will help establish regulations for future floating plants."
</blockquote>
</figure>

The FNPPs were expected to be located 2.8 miles from shore, within the extent of
the Federal Territorial Limit and State Jurisdictional Limits at the time.

The plant was to be designed to operate during the 100-year storm and shutdown safely in
the 1,000,000-year storm. Vast amounts of wave testing in scale models was performed.

The EPA [was informed of dredge and
fill](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=msu.31293201477555&view=1up&seq=335)
permitting activities in 1972.

The Coast Guard was [involved in review of the concept](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu14296071&view=1up&seq=148) in 1972 as well.

A License to Manufacture eight FNPPs was tendered on January 22, 1973 and docketed on July
5, 1973 with Docket No. STN 50-437. The application included a Plant Design Report and an
Environmental Report.

(Actually if you're searching the NRC ADAMS website, you should search for Docket Number
05000437 in order to find OPS documents).

In 1975, the NRC issued a massive [712-page Environmental Statement regarding offshore
nuclear
plants](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ien.35556030595474&view=thumb&seq=141)
(NUREG-75/113). It covered potential siting options for these plants from the Gulf of
Maine to the coast of Texas, with a wide variety of topics in some depth, including:

- The need for power capacity
- A description of the offshore station with water usage, heat dissipation, radioactive
  wastes, chemical discharges, sanitary discharges, platform support system, land-based
  support facilities, and transmission facilities
- Design basis requirements
- A vast characterization of the relevant coastal environment across the US coast,
  including bathymetry, sediment descriptions and transport, climate, hydrology,
  biological oceanography, and terrestrial and wetland ecology.
- Environmental impacts due to construction (including the effects of the transport of the
  FNPP to a typical site)
- Environmental impacts of station operations on aquatic biota, effects of chemical and
  biocide discharges , and effects of temperature chages on phytoplankton, benthos, and
  fishes.
- Effluent and environmental measurement and monitoring programs (meteorological,
  hydraulic, thermal, radiological, and ecological)
- Environmental effects of postulated accidents
- Coastal zone siting implications
- Study of alternative energy sources and sites
- Cost/benefit analysis
- Discussion of comments received

A separate supplement was provided specifically treating the issues of liquid pathways for
potential radiological releases in FNPPs.

## Benefits of a permanent manufacturing facility

Manufacturing was to be done in production line fashion at a facility on Blount Island in
Jacksonville, FL. The plant was designed to produce 4 FNPPs per year. Around 1500 people
worked on the project, which was designed and dredged and constructed. The 900-ton gantry
crane was purchased and installed.

</div>

Building nuclear plants at a manufacturing facility has major quality,
environmental, and cost advantages over building at each individual site<sup>2</sup>.

- Quality control during construction is improved since the same personnel are used for each plant.
- Steady nature of work ensures good labor supply independent of local site
- Permanently erected heavy equipment and specialized welding, forming, and inspection equipment expedite all phases
- Major components can be preassembled and tested in specially equipped testing rigs. Upon assembly, the entire plant is tested in testing rigs as well. The turbine can be rolled with steam produced in manufacturing site boilers

These benefits are _perfectly aligned_ with decades of consensus between nuclear
experts on what the [main cost drivers of nuclear are]({% link economics.md %}#the-oecdnea-capital-cost-study).

Here are some figures showing the construction sequence:

Effective, January 1, 1975, Tenneco liquidated its share and OPS became a 99/1 JV between
Westinghouse and Westinghouse International Power Systems Company, Inc. (I don't know why
it wasn't just all Westinghouse at this point...).

In 1978, the NRC recommended the issuance of a manufacturing license to OPS, allowing them
to manufacture nuclear plants at the Blount Island facility. It emphasized that some of
the environmental impacts could not be treated completely generally and would require more
work for individual sites. Then the Three Mile Island accident occurred in 1979 and some
additional modifications to the design were recommended.

In 1979, at the NRC's request, OPS added a core ladle to the design made of magnesium
oxide (MgO) or equivalent refractory material to provide resistance to a core melt-through
and to provide additional delay time so that interdictive measures could be taken in
severe accidents. Specifically, the NRC required a minimum delay time of 2 days.

</figure>

By 1981, OPS had invested $125 million into its manufacturing facility on Blount
Island.<sup>9</sup> The company was eager to get an official license to build, claiming
that pre-licensed plants are significantly easier to sell to customers. In October 1981,
the NRC's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) reported that:

> The Floating Nuclear Plant units can be manufactured with reasonable assurance that they
> can be sited and operated without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.

The [manufacturing license to
construct](https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20070J215)
the first 8 3411 MWt reactors [was issued on December 17.
1982](https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20070J219).

## So what happened?

When the idea was born in 1969, everyone thought electricity demand was going to
increase at 8%/year forever. After the 1973 oil shocks, the big customers in New Jersey
(oil refineries) had far less demand than anticipated. By the time the OPS plants were
ready to be produced, PSE&G could no longer justify the additional generation capacity.
OPS held on for as long as it could but never was able to secure another customer. TMI had
just happened and the industry was in a period of uncertainty. Eventually, they bit the
bullet and shut down the production facility and the effort ended.

### The general safety case (or, why it's not a mobile Chernobyl)

The fundamental safety challenge in nuclear power is maintaining cooling of [decay
heat]({% link decay-heat.html %}). Nuclear reactors don't shut all the way down when the
control rods go in; they drop to 7% of full power while the fission products start to
slowly release their residual energy. After a day it's at 1%. After 4 days it's at 0.5%,
and so on. Of course, 1% of 3 gigawatts is 30 million watts. Thus, plants must have
reliable means of removing the heat after shutdown. Failure of this cooling caused the
accidents at Three Mile Island (a valve was stuck open and the cooling water was lost) and
at Fukushima (the tsunami took out the fuel supply for the backup diesel generators, which
were in the basement instead of above grade where they should have been in a tsunami
zone).

The much lauded advanced reactors of the world almost always feature passive decay heat
removal systems. They use exotic coolants like sodium metal or molten salt which can
naturally circulate with no external power, dumping their heat to the environment through
passive heat exchangers.

At sea, you are floating in the world's largest heat sink. In any and every scenario,
there is sufficient cooling water to use, regardless of plant design.

The largest natural cause of potential decay heat loss on Earth is, of course, the earthquake.
At sea, you are decoupled from the ground acceleration and will not experience violent
shaking. Tsunamis are in the sea, of course, but in moderately deep water their
wavelengths are enormous. They only become destructive when they crash into the shore.

Lastly, when you're a few miles out at sea, very few people will be nearby. In the worst
imaginable impossible case, radiation dose rates would be much diminished.

In return, you do have to deal with ship collisions, hurricanes, and storm swells.
Critics also worried that if the core were to be severely damaged somehow and melt through
all layers of containment, the energetics of hot core hitting the ocean could have caused
a serious radiological event. With the core ladle and infinite heat sink, such an event is
unlikely. Of course, the nuclear industry lost a lot of its credibility with statements
like this after TMI.

Net, offshore nuclear plants produced in a shipyard offer rare combination of
improved safety and improved cost.

## Modern Echos

In 2010, the U.S.S. _Carl Vinson_ aircraft carrier used it's [nuclear-powered oceanwater
desalination capabilities (400,000 gallons/day capacity) to provide relief to the
incapacitated water
network](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DISPATCHB-929) (paywall)
at Port-au-Prince, Haiti after a devastating earthquake.

Many teams are talking about and actually building shipyard constructed FNPPs today. Most
of the modern concepts do not have the massive concrete breakwater.
In 2016, MIT published a study of a new [Offshore Floating Nuclear Plant
Concept](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106334). in 2019, China [announced that they would
start building FNPPs to power islets and offshore drilling platforms in the South China
Sea.](https://asiatimes.com/2019/03/ocean-going-nuclear-plants-for-south-china-sea/)
In December 2019, the Russian [Akademik
Lomonosov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Lomonosov) FNPP began operating in the
Arctic.

Some small advanced nuclear companies are planning to use shipyard construction and/or
floating operation. [ThorCon plans](https://thorconpower.com/our-plants/) to use shipyard
construction but then deliver their plants to land-based sites. OPS had a similar option
for riverine sites. [Seaborg plans
to](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/17/floating-mini-nukes-could-power-countries-by-2025-says-startup)
operate their reactors offshore.

In 2020, South Korea's Kepco Engineering and Construction Company and Daewoo Shipbuilding
and Marine Engineering [signed a MOU to develop offshore nuclear
plants](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kepco-E-C-teams-up-with-shipbuilder-for-floating-r).
This team is particularly interesting because they combine one of the best and most mature
reactor teams with one of the best shipbuilders.

With climate change looming, FNPPs may be one of the best ways to build vast amounts of
very low-carbon nuclear plants in record-breaking time with unsurpassed quality and
economics. Tens of millions of dollars have already been spent on a massive amount of
environmental impact. The Coast Guard, EPA, NRC, and ACRS had reason to sign-off on the
concept in the environmentalist era. The NRC even accepted modifications made after the
TMI accident. professional environmentalists who worked on it came to like the concept.

I knew I liked the concept of floating nuclear power plants to fight climate change
before, but I was worried about all the studies of environmental impacts that would need
to be performed first. Now that I realize that well-funded studies have already
concluded successfully, I'm even more emboldened to like and promote the idea of FNPPs for
climate.
