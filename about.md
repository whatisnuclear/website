We are a group of nuclear engineers hoping to help the world learn some interesting and
important information about nuclear energy. We find ourselves explaining things like waste recycling
and passive safety over and over to an interested, diverse, and rather receptive audience. We aim to enlighten the
public about the capabilities of nuclear energy so that society may embrace it as an improvement in
many aspects over current energy sources. Someday, we may be able to run the planet purely on solar
power or fusion, but until then, we consider nuclear fission to be the energy source with the
best capacity to produce world-scale energy responsibly. This website is non-profit, build entirely
by volunteers. We have no funding and no ads.   

## Philosophy
In order for a technology to be convincingly superior to others, it must not only present compelling
advantages, but also must concede to its weaknesses and demonstrate acceptable responses to its
harshest criticism. Nuclear energy has drawbacks. We won&rsquo;t try to cover these up, but rather
will try to present them clearly and explain or propose solutions to the problems. Too many times
have we read that this or that is the only thing that can save the planet. We will avoid this
hysteria and strive to provide calm and true information and perspectives.

<h5>Articles, editing, sysadmin</h5>

I'm a reactor physicist working on the design of an advanced nuclear reactor for a nuclear
innovation company, where I&rsquo;ve been since 2009. I have a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the
University of Michigan based on the multiobjective optimization of fast reactors using
perturbation-based equilibrium cycle methods. <a href="https://partofthething.com">Visit my personal

## Citing us

If you want to cite our entire site, use something like:
<p class="bg-warning"><em>What is Nuclear?</em> whatisnuclear.com. Accessed 23 Jun. 2024.</p>

If you want to reference just a single page, it may look like:

<p class="bg-warning">Touran, Nick. &quot;What is Nuclear Waste?&quot; <em>WhatIsNuclear</em>, whatisnuclear.com/waste.html. Accessed 23 Jun. 2024.</p>

If no Author is listed on a given article, just assume it is Nick Touran. Publication dates vary and
things are continuously updated so the Accessed date is more better than nothing if no publication
date is given.
