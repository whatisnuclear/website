We are a group of nuclear engineers hoping to help the world learn some
interesting and important information about nuclear energy. We find ourselves
explaining things like waste recycling and passive safety over and over to an
interested, diverse, and rather receptive audience. We aim to enlighten the
public about the capabilities of nuclear energy so that society may embrace it
as an improvement in many aspects over current energy sources. Someday, we may
be able to run the planet purely on solar power or fusion, but until then, we
consider nuclear fission to be the energy source with the best capacity to
produce world-scale energy responsibly. This website is built entirely by
volunteers. We have no funding and no ads.

## Philosophy

In order for a technology to be convincingly superior to others, it must not
only present compelling advantages, but also must concede to its weaknesses and
demonstrate acceptable responses to its harshest criticism. Nuclear energy has
drawbacks. We won't try to cover these up, but rather will try to present
them clearly and explain or propose solutions to the problems. Too many times
have we read that this or that is the only thing that can save the planet. We
will avoid this hysteria and strive to provide calm and true information and
perspectives.

## Affiliations

This page was originally started by nuclear engineering students at the
University of Michigan, but we have since graduated and moved into various other
institutions. All information and opinions on this site are our own
perspectives, and do not represent the views of our employers. The site servers
and DNS names are funded out of our contributors' pockets and all writing is
done for free on our own time.

<h5>Articles, editing, sysadmin</h5>

I'm a reactor physicist working on the design of an advanced nuclear reactor for a nuclear
innovation company, where I've been since 2009. I have a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the
University of Michigan based on the multiobjective optimization of fast reactors using
perturbation-based equilibrium cycle methods. <a href="https://partofthething.com">Visit my personal

## Citing us

If you want to cite our entire site, use something like:

<p class="bg-warning"><em>What is Nuclear?</em> whatisnuclear.com. Accessed 23 Jun. 2024.</p>

If you want to reference just a single page, it may look like:

<p class="bg-warning">Touran, Nick. &quot;What is Nuclear Waste?&quot; <em>WhatIsNuclear</em>, whatisnuclear.com/waste.html. Accessed 23 Jun. 2024.</p>

If no Author is listed on a given article, just assume it is Nick Touran. Publication dates vary and
things are continuously updated so the Accessed date is more better than nothing if no publication
date is given.
