title: We should rename nuclear energy
category: blog
description: >
  Nuclear energy needs a new name to differentiate it from nuclear weapons. 
  Besides, most energy sources are named after their fuel rather than their entire field of physics.
  As the field of nuclear physics has developed, it's now time to graduate into being more
  specific.

The term *nuclear* as in *nuclear energy*, *nuclear plants*, etc. is problematic as a
description of the peaceful low-carbon energy source.

The problem becomes abundantly clear when talk of nuclear weaponry ramps up, as it has
during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We hear about _nuclear issues_, _nuclear concerns_
_nuclear threats_, etc., and it all just spills over from the civilization-destroying
weapons to the climate-saving power stations.

Institutions created to stop atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons seamlessly pivoted to
include protests of nuclear reactors without even changing the slogans of "NO NUCLEAR",
etc.

Most energy sources are named after their fuel rather than their entire field of physics.
As the field of nuclear physics has developed, it's now time to graduate into being more
specific. After all, debating about whether or not you like energy from the field of
chemistry (_chemical energy_) would be effectively meaningless, as it covers batteries,
fossil fuel, hydrogen, biofuels, etc. Imagine a _NO CHEMISTRY_ campaign!

Similarly, nuclear physics covers a wide variety of technologies, including nuclear
weapons, nuclear medicine, traditional uranium converter reactors, exotic uranium
converter reactors, uranium breeder reactors, thorium breeder reactors, D-T fusion power,
aneutronic fusion, etc.

So we need to update the lexicon. Here are some collected thoughts from various threads
and discussions:

## Options

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><th>Name</th><th >Advantages</th><th >Disadvantages</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>Nuclear energy</td>
    <td>Includes fission (both uranium and thorium) as well as fusion</td>
    <td>Overlaps with terminology used for terrifying weapons. Very broad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Atomic energy</td>
    <td>Somehow sounds nicer these days. Still includes uranium/thorium/fusion</td>
    <td>Was the original term for weapons. Still used for weapons. Very broad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Fission energy</td>
    <td>Clearly differentiated from thermonuclear weaponry</td>
    <td>Does not include fusion energy (feature rather than bug?). Still fairly broad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Uranium energy</td>
    <td>
        Consistent with other energy sources, using the name of the specific fuel rather
        than the field of physics. For example, coal plants aren't called 'chemical plants'.
    </td>
    <td>Excludes thorium and fusion (feature rather than bug?).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Stardust energy</td>
    <td>
        Sounds super cool and modern. Accurate since fission fuel was formed in supernova
        and neutron star mergers
    </td>
    <td>Technically, everything else is made of stardust too</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Quantum energy</td>
    <td>Sounds cool. Clearly separate from weapons</td>
    <td>Sounds kind of goofy and crazy. Technically, everything is quantum</td>
</tr>

## Path Forward

So how will we go about moving forward with this? Simple! We'll chat about it some and
reach a consensus and then I'll update this page with the choice. We can discuss it on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/whatisnuclear/status/1515362262722170881),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whatisnuclear/posts/5848510328497208),
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/u50xbn/we_should_rename_nuclear_energy/),
etc. I have created [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/whatisnuclear/website/issues/13)
to track the progress and I'll close it once we're all in agreement. We'll add more
options and analysis as they are proposed.

## Final Conclusion

Stay tuned

## Sidenotes

- Q: Should we try to make it something really warm and fuzzy, analogous to _natural gas_? A: Maybe
- Q: Will we have to change the name of this website? A: Nah.
