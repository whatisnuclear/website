Nuclear waste is made of radioactive atoms generated after large atoms split.  Nuclear
reactors make nuclear waste during operation. The physics leverage of E=MC² makes nuclear
waste uniquely *concentrated*; it's both extraordinarily small and seriously hazardous.
The relatively tiny amount of waste is intriguing in that its overall environmental,
health, and land footprint can be minimal. But, there is legitimate concern that the
hazards may be difficult to contain.

This page *digs in* to the nuance of nuclear waste, and points to additional information for

## What exactly is Nuclear Waste?
Nuclear energy is released when a nuclear fuel nucleus snaps into two in a [reactor]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link reactors.md %}). The key component
of nuclear waste is the leftover smaller nuclei, known as fission products.

3 neutrons."/></a>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">The fission process of a single atomic
nucleus. Note that Krypton and Cesium are two possible fission products, but
many other pairs of elements also occur.</figcaption>
</figure>

From the outside, nuclear waste looks exactly like the fuel that was loaded into the
reactor &mdash; typically assemblies of cylindrical metal rods enclosing fuel pellets. But
because nuclear reactions have occurred, the contents aren't quite the same.

Like everything, nuclear waste is made of elements you can find on the periodic table,
including [isotopes]({% link isotopes.md %}) of iron, zinc, germanium, zirconium, silver,
and iodine. You never know which two fission product elements you're going to get for a
given fission event, but you always get the same average composition as billions upon
billions of atoms split. You basically get a huge variety of elements, shown below.

products."/> <figcaption class="figure-caption">The fission products include radioactive <a href="{% link
isotopes.md %}">isotopes</a> of the elements shown here. Color is proportional to the log
of the probability they will show up (U-235 thermal fission from ENDF/VII.1).
</figcaption>
</figure>

Nuclear fuel loaded into commercial reactors is generally in the form of solid
ceramic pellets that are stacked into metal tubes and bundled together in fuel assemblies.
After the atoms in the pellet split to release their energy, the pellets in tubes emerge as 
nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is roughly in the same form as the pellets that went in, and
basically has the consistency of a teacup. Commercial nuclear waste is not green ooze
(which may have been inspired by liquid-form nuclear weapons waste like that at 
[Hanford]({% link hanford.md %})).

it is only slightly radioactive and can be handled with a glove. After fission occurs, it

You may also hear nuclear waste referred to as *spent nuclear fuel* or *used nuclear
fuel*. These terms are intended to indicate that it is recyclable, but they all refer to
the stuff known commonly as *nuclear waste*.

## What are the hazards of nuclear waste?

When a nucleus splits, most of the energy is released immediately and carried off by
coolant to do useful work. However, energy continues to be released for thousands of years
after the atom splits. This *afterglow heat* is what makes nuclear waste hazardous. Unlike
most toxic waste, the fact that nuclear waste becomes less toxic with time is quite unique.

<figure> <a href="/img/fission-energy.svg"><img
src="/img/blank.png"
data-echo="/img/fission-energy.svg" alt="Fission energy bar graph showing afterglow heat"
class="img img-fluid center-block" ></a>  

<figcaption class="figure-caption" markdown="1">
How much energy comes out [via different mechanisms]({% link
radioactivity.md%}#types-of-nuclear-radiation) after you fission 1 kg of Uranium-235. This
much fission is typical of one day of operation of a large gigawatt-scale power plant,
powering a city of about 1 million people. Note that in the long term, energy from the
alpha-decay of materials heavier than uranium produce the majority of the heat rather than
fission (not shown).
</figcaption>
</figure>

These delayed energetic emissions mean that nuclear waste is highly [radioactive]({% link
radioactivity.md %}).  When it first comes out of the reactor, it is so hazardous that if
you stood close to it while it was unshielded, you would receive a lethal radiation dose
within a few seconds and would die of [acute radiation sickness
[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_poisoning) within a few days. As the
energy emerges, the waste becomes less radioactive (and so also less hazardous) every
moment. Still, it does not transform from hazardous to benign for thousands of years.

<figcaption class="figure-caption">How dangerous nuclear waste is to eat as a function of time compared to eating

faster if you recycle the waste and burn the very long-lived radionuclides as

The nuclear waste question fundamentally asks whether or not humanity can prevent this
radioactive material from causing harm to people and the environment.  This question was
recognized early on in nuclear history, by Enrico Fermi himself (the lead scientist in
charge of the world's first man-made nuclear chain reaction), who stated:

> It is not clear that the public will accept an energy source that produces this much
> radioactivity
>
> &mdash; Enrico Fermi

Since he made that statement, we have gained more than 60 years of experience with nuclear
power stations. So how have we done?


## What do we currently do with our nuclear waste?
<a name="current"></a>
In practice, the spent fuel is never unshielded. It is kept underwater (water is an
excellent shield) for 5--8 years in *spent fuel pools* until the radiation levels decay to
levels that can be cooled without water.

After cooling in the spent fuel pools, nuclear waste is either recycled (France) or moved
into large concrete canisters called *dry casks* (most other places). These casks hold
several spent fuel assemblies each.

To our knowledge, no one has been injured or killed by commercial nuclear waste in dry
cask storage. While future incidents are possible, it is fairly clear that the rate of
injury from this material pales almost in insignificance compared to the 8 million people
per year who actually do die from [air pollution complications caused by fossil fuel and
biofuel emissions (WHO numbers)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution). 

The fact that nuclear plants keep all of their waste on site for their entire lifecycle can 
be considered a major positive environmental attribute compared with energy sources that emit vast
waste into the atmosphere or produce vast manufacturing wastes during fabrication.

Here's a [great video showing actual spent fuel operations in a nuclear power
plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mILvWNgggfU).
</div>

In France, the waste that comes out of the recycling process (discussed below) is [turned
into glass in a process called
vitrification](https://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Vitrified_HA_Waste.htm), and
then stored in air-draft cooling racks.

<a name="whattodo"></a>
## What are the long-term options for nuclear waste?

Dry cask storage above ground is quite stable, but both nuclear advocates and opponents
can agree that there are reasons to try to get it even further away from the biosphere.

### Deep geologic disposal

There is scientific consensus that putting the nuclear waste in geologic formations that
are expected to be stable for many millions of years is appropriate (e.g. see the [Blue
Ribbon Commission report (pdf)](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf) and
the [2020 OECD report](http://www.oecd-nea.org/rwm/pubs/2020/7532-dgr-geological-disposal-radioactive-waste.pdf)
(pdf) on waste disposal).  This way, if the material is released in the far future, it
will have already released all of its afterglow heat and will be radiologically inert.

The US studied and constructed large portions of Yucca Mountain as the national spent
fuel disposal site, but the community was not consulted sufficiently beforehand, and the
project suffered what can only be called a political death.

The US does have an operational nuclear waste repository in a massive salt formation in
New Mexico at a site called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. It is designed for military
nuclear waste rather than civilian, but many of the challenges are related.

Finland is currently the world leader in long-term commercial nuclear waste disposal
progress. Their Onkalo deep geologic repository is [expected to the be the world's first
commercial one to
operate](https://psmag.com/ideas/the-hiding-place-inside-the-worlds-first-long-term-storage-facility-for-highly-radioactive-nuclear-waste). They produced
an excellent video describing the plan.

</div>

### Deep Boreholes

A different form of geologic repository, called a deep borehole, has been proposed by
scientists since the 1950s, and has recently gotten much more attention due to advances in
drilling techniques. Deep boreholes involve drilling a hole about 5000 meter deep and
stacking the spent fuel assemblies there before capping it off. By going ~10x deeper than
traditional repository designs, the material is likely to be extra isolated from the
biosphere for extra time.

</figcaption>
</figure>

The US DOE planned a Deep Borehole Field Test to better understand the science of this
technology option (without any actual nuclear waste), but the [project was cancelled in
2017 due to strong public
opposition](https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/trump-administration-dropping-nuclear-waste-burial-test/article_414da917-be8c-5625-be62-7b953639220c.html). 

Deep boreholes are being commercialized by a company called [Deep
Isolation](https://www.deepisolation.com/). 

### Recycling nuclear waste

Nuclear waste generally is over 90% uranium. Thus, the spent fuel (waste) still contains
90% usable fuel! It can be chemically processed and placed in other reactors to <em>close
the fuel cycle</em>. A closed fuel cycle means much less nuclear waste and much more
energy extracted from the raw ore. Additionally, this process allows you to convert your
waste into chemical forms that are totally immobilized.

France currently recycles their spent fuel. They put the remaining good nuclear fuel back
in their reactors in the form of MOX fuel and immobilize the remaining waste in vitrified
borosilicate glass.

The US had a recycling program featuring the use of <a href="{% link fast-reactor.md
%}">advanced fast reactors</a> (which have not been deployed on any major scale yet) that
was shut down because it created Plutonium, which could be used to make a nuclear weapon.
Were some plutonium diverted in the recycling process, a non-nuclear entity could be one
step close to building a bomb. However, under programs such as the (now stalled) <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Framework_for_Nuclear_Energy_Cooperation">GNEP
[wikipedia]</a>, where only countries who already have nuclear weapons recycle,
proliferation-free waste recycling can exist. Since the many of the largest energy users
are already nuclear weapons states, a massive expansion of nuclear could be done there
with no additional proliferation concerns whatsoever.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1">
You will find more discussion of proliferation on our [nonproliferation page]({% link
non-proliferation.md %}).  Please remember to [contact us](/contact.html) with your
comments or questions. 
</div>

The longest living nuclides in nuclear waste are the ones that can be used as fuel:
plutonium and the minor actinides. If these materials are burnt in fuel through recycling,
nuclear waste would only remain radioactive for a few hundred years, as opposed to a few
hundred thousand. This significantly reduces concerns with long-term storage.  This
concept is called Partitioning and Transmutation and is discussed in elaborate detail in
[this IAEA
report](https://www.iaea.org/publications/7112/implications-of-partitioning-and-transmutation-in-radioactive-waste-management). 

<span class="badge bg-success">See Also</span> See our [main recycling page]({% link
recycling.md %}) for a more thorough discussion of recycling.

### Transportation

How does nuclear waste move from the reactor to the disposal site? We have developed
containers that can handle the hazards of transportation without breaking. The US DOE and
others have for example tested these containers by burning them in jet fuel, smashing into
them with rocket-powered trains, crashing them into cement walls, and dropping them onto
spikes.

Still, some communities have expressed concern that, even if the radiation doesn't leak,
there could be a long delay on rail traffic if a derailment happens. This can be a major
concern in the oil field areas of Texas where many millions of dollars of oil are rail
shipped out per day. So it's not just about radiological safety, but also these kinds of
subtler concerns that must be considered.


### Crazy ideas

Other things have been proposed as a solution for nuclear waste but are mostly bad ideas. 

* Launch it into the sun. The sun would indeed consume it, but launch reliability would
  have to be vastly better than it is today. A space elevator might make this a viable
  option. 

* Use it to sanitize municipal waste water. The radiation can sterilize without using
  chemicals like bleach. But the potential to steal it or for it to catch on fire or
  something is not worth the risk.

* Use it to power batteries. Many space probes do use material made in nuclear reactors.
  But only a tiny fraction of the material has found useful scientific/military uses at
  this point, and it's unlikely the rest will be too useful, again because of the hazards.

<a name="howmuch"></a>

## How much nuclear waste does nuclear energy create?
If all the electricity use of the USA was distributed evenly among its population, and all of it came 
from nuclear power, then the amount of nuclear waste each person would generate per year would be 
**39.5 grams**. That's the weight of seven U. S. quarters of waste, per year! A detailed description 
of this result can be found [here](/assets/waste_per_person.pdf). If we got all our electricity 
from coal and natural gas, expect to have over 10,000 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>/yr attributed to 
each person, not to mention other poisonous emissions directly to the biosphere 
(based on EIA [emissions
data](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/ghg_report/ghg_carbon.php)). 

If you want raw numbers: in 2018, there were just over 80,000 metric tonnes of high-level
waste in the USA.  Between 1971 and 2018, nuclear reactors in the USA generated 3000
GW-years of electricity to make this waste. 

For comparison, in 2007 alone the US burned 948,000,000 metric tonnes of coal. This means
that coal plants made 32 times more waste **every single day** than the US nuclear fleet
has made **in the past 45 years!** Granted, coal made a higher fraction of the country's
electricity, but the numbers are still crazy impressive for nuclear.

The astoundingly low amount of nuclear waste is thanks to the near magical energy
density of the atom.

<a name="composition"></a>
## Composition of nuclear waste

Spent nuclear fuel composition varies depending on what was put into the reactor, how long
the reactor operated, and how long the waste has been sitting out of the reactor. A
typical US reactor's waste composition is laid out in **table 1**. Notice that most of the
Uranium is still in the fuel when it leaves the reactor, even though its enrichment has
fallen significantly. This Uranium can be used in [advanced fast reactors]({% link
fast-reactor.md %}) as fuel and is a valuable energy source. The **minor actinides**,
which include Neptunium, Americium, and Curium, are long-lived nuclides that cause serious
concern when it comes to storing them for more than 100,000 years. Fortunately, these are
fissionable in fast reactors and can thus be used as fuel! This still would leave us with
the **fission products**. The decay of each nuclide vs. time is shown below.
