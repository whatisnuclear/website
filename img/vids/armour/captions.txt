Armour Research Reactor Logo
Model of whole Armour reactor facility
Model of core and shield
Assembling 10 sections of cooling coils
They have a total length of 90 ft.
Distilled water circulates through coils
Seam welding the core vessel hemispheres
Installing the graphite reflector blocks around the (inverted) core/fuel overflow assembly
The reflector blocks were hand-cut to ensure a close fit
A tube through the center to permit specimen exposure
Stacking reflector blocks 5 feet around the aluminum outer envelope which can be removed and reinstalled for repair
Biological shielding was provided by 5' wall of dense iron ore concrete. A Single bucket weighs 6000 lbs
Instrumentation system
Control console
Model of the reactor and control rods with lights
4 vertical B4C control rods encased in stainless steel for regulation and shut down
Pressing the SCRAM button cuts power to electromagnetic rod couplings to drop the rods
The reactor fuel is uranyl sulfate dissolved in distilled water, 88% enriched U-235
Negative fuel and gas reactivity feedbacks depicted graphically as a backup safety feature

Radioactive C-14 is being created from irradiated CO2 for tracer research
Activation analysis detecting tiny impurities
Effects of radiation on transistors and semiconductors being studies
Extensive research on how radioactive phosphorous is absorbed into tomatoes to understand
Measuring the tomatoes
Diagnostic test of the thyroid. She drank tracer amount of radioactive iodine. The detector is a scintillator.
Additional testing in hot cell with manipulators
