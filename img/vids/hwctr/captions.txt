High temperature and pressure non-nuclear studies on lattices
Computer studies were performed
Nuclear Metals Incorporated co-extruding tubular uranium metal fuel elements
Fabrication techniques were studied systematically
Test fuel was irradiated in Vallecitos BWR 
Fuel was also irradiated in the E20 loop at NRU in Canada
Hot cell studies and post irradiation examination at SRS
