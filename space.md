Nuclear energy is a wonderful energy source for space. As you go away from the
sun, solar panels struggle to gather enough energy to run a spacecraft or
probe, and chemical rocket fuel tanks would just be too big.  Many famous
missions depended on nuclear energy (Cassini, Mars Rover, Voyager, etc.). 

## Nuclear isotopes in space

Cassini, rovers, etc. have been powered by something called a radioisotopic
thermal generator (RTG). These devices use radioactive isotopes produced in
nuclear reactors on Earth (usually Plutonium-238) coupled to a device that can
convert heat directly to electricity. RTGs are kind of like really long-lived
batteries that can provide tens or hundreds of Watts for decades. 

## Nuclear reactors in space
Nuclear reactors can be used in space to produce heat, electricity, and/or
propulsion. They could be used to power a Mars or Moon base or configured as a
nuclear-powered rocket to get around out there. 

In November 2020, a [company called Space Nuclear Power Corporation was spun
out](https://www.nucnet.org/news/new-us-company-to-develop-los-alamos-kilopower-reactor-11-5-2020)
of a Los Alamos National Lab effort to commercialize space-based nuclear reactors.

Here's an excellent summary of nuclear technology in space from an
astronuclear engineer named Chris Morrison:
