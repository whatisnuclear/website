title: Sodium Graphite Reactors
description: >
  The Sodium Graphite Reactor (SGR) is a nearly-forgotten nuclear reactor
  design intended to make economical power by combining the
  high-temperature/low-pressure nature of sodium liquid metal coolant with the
  fissile efficiency enabled by a graphite moderator. In Hallam, Nebraska, one
  such SGR shared a turbine with a coal plant.

In the 1950s, hordes of nuclear reactor designers were rushing to find out
[which combination of coolant, moderator, and fuel types]({% link reactors.md
%}#types) would be the most economical for commercial power production. Along
the way, someone came up with the idea of using sodium metal coolant with
graphite moderator. It's a sodium-cooled _slow_ reactor (as opposed to the more
common sodium-cooled fast reactor). The idea here was to capture the following
benefits:

- Sodium metal coolant can be brought to higher temperature than high-pressure water,
  allowing higher thermal efficiency (more heat can be converted to electricity when
  the heat is higher temperature). Thus, you can get more revenue for the same amount
  of nuclear heat and equipment, and therefore be more economical.

- Sodium metal coolant remains at low pressure even at these high temperature. Thus,
  the thickness of pipes and protection equipment to deal with high-pressure
  leaks in water-cooled reactors can be reduced/eliminated.

- Graphite moderator allows reactors to work with very little fissile mass
  and [enrichment]({% link enrichment.md %}).
  This allows operation with natural or low-enriched uranium, as opposed to
  sodium-cooled [fast reactors]({% link fast-reactor.md %}), which require ~12% or higher
  enrichment (or fissile concentration) to start up and maintain a neutron chain reaction.

The first two benefits are shared with the far more well-known sodium-cooled fast reactor
(SFR) design, but the last one is what's so special about SGRs. When high-fissile fuel such
as HALEU or HEU or Plutonium is a little hard to come by, SGRs shine. This condition exists
in any country that is not aggressively reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel.

The first vocal champion of the SGR design was [Chauncey
Starr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauncey_Starr), best known for later
founding the non-profit, [Electrical Power Research Institute
(EPRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Power_Research_Institute). While
at Atomics International, he edited [an entire book about
SGRs](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015003993881&view=1up&seq=7)
that was released globally at the 2nd Atoms for Peace convention in 1958 and can
be read in full today for free.

As was typical in the [history of reactor development]({% link reactor_history.md
%}), we developed, built, and operated two SGRs:

- A reactor experiment: [Sodium Reactor Experiment
  (SRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_Reactor_Experiment) 29 miles NW of
  Los Angeles, California.
- A power prototype: [Hallam Nuclear Power Facility
  (HNPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallam_Nuclear_Power_Facility) 18 miles SE
  of Lincoln, Nebraska.

As was common in the pioneering days of nuclear, these reactors were not without
issues. SRE had a coolant issue that led to melted fuel, and Hallam had issues
with the moderator cans leaking, allowing sodium to contact the graphite and
cause swelling. The vendor, Atomics International, figured out solutions to
these issues but did not make enough progress to convince Consumers Public Power
District (the utility partner) to purchase Hallam at that time. Thus, as was
the deal in the AEC's Power Demonstration Reactor Program (PDRP), the AEC would
decommission the plant.

Consumers entered into the experimental reactor program knowing they needed the
power for their customers one way or another. Because sodium-cooled reactors can
generate steam of the exact same quality as a coal plant, they decided to build
a coal-fired plant right next to the HNPF and hook it up to the **exact same
turbine-generator set**. When the nuclear plant would be down, the coal plant
could fill the gap, and the customers could have reliable power. The plant
as a whole was (and still is) called Sheldon Power Station.

As far as we're aware, this was the only time in history that a nuclear and coal
plant have fed steam into a shared turbine.
