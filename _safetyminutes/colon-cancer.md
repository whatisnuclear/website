Colorectral (colon) cancer is a cancer of the colon or rectrum 
and occurs primarily as people age. Additional risk factors include [2]:

* Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
* A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps.
* A genetic syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary
  non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).

And lifestyle factors[1]:
* Lack of regular physical activity.
* A diet low in fruit and vegetables.
* A low-fiber and high-fat diet, or a diet high in processed meats.
* Overweight and obesity.
* Alcohol consumption.
* Tobacco use.


Symptoms may include [2]:

* A change in bowel habits (like skinny pencil-thin stools)
* Blood in or on your stool (bowel movement).
* Diarrhea, constipation, or feeling that the bowel does not empty all the way.
* Abdominal pain, aches, or cramps that don’t go away.
* Weight loss and you don’t know why.

In 2020, a new development in colorectal screening is that the CDC now
<strong>recommends that you get a colonoscopy at age 45 now</strong>. This used to start at age
50 [3].
