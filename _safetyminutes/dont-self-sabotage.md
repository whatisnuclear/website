title: Don't self-sabotage during meetings
description: >
   Inefficiency and bad work can reduce morale and delay deployment of
   low-carbon and low-pollution energy facilities, harming both institutional
   efficacy as well as global public health. By understanding what professional
   civilian saboteurs do, we can learn to recognize ineffective processes within
   our own organizations.

# What Happened

In 1944, the OSS (predecessor to the CIA) published a booklet [1] describing how
to introduce friction into professional settings via corporate sabotage.

Some examples of sabotage included in the booklet as related to meetings
are as follows. You may find some of these surprisingly familiar to a typical
meeting in highly regulated industries.

# Lessons

1. Spend the time to include detailed meeting agendas in meeting invites, and stick to them
2. Maintain a focus on action during meetings: it's not about what you know, it's about how
   to proceed.
3. Always track meeting discussion and actions in written meeting minutes, and
   refer to previous minutes in the agendas for follow-up meetings. If an action is
   required for a future meeting, ensure that this meeting is referred to in the
   follow-up meeting's agenda and minutes.
4. Ensure a meeting chair is empowered to cut off-topic discussions short, enforce
   adherence to the agenda, and make final decisions if there is serious conflict.
