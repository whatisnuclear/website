Skin cancer is the most common kind of cancer. Most are caused by exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, often from the sun. There are three kinds of cells in the
skin:

- Squamous cells
- Basal cells
- Melanocytes

Each kind of cell can form a cancer. Squamous and Basal cell cancers are the
most common. Melanoma causes the most deaths because of its tendency to spread
into vital organs, including the brain.

The warning signs of melanoma are A-B-C-D-E [1]:

- Asymmetrical: Does the mole or spot have an irregular shape with two parts that look very different?
- Border: Is the border irregular or jagged?
- Color: Is the color uneven?
- Diameter: Is the mole or spot larger than the size of a pea?
- Evolving: Has the mole or spot changed during the past few weeks or months?

If you see these, take a photo on your phone and go talk to your doctor.
