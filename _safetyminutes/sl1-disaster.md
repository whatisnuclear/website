# What happened?

The Armyâ€™s SL-1 (Stationary, Low-power 1) in Idaho was part of the Army Package
Power Program, previously called the Argonne Low Power Reactor, ALPR. It was
designed to be built on the tundra above the DEW line to power radar stations.
It suffered an explosion on January 3, 1961 that resulted in 3 gruesome casualties.

Three military staff were on shift, working on the reactor head to adjust the
control rod drives mechanisms and housing. For unknown reasons, one or more of
them manually withdrew the central control rod to the 20-inch mark (well beyond
specifications) with less than maximum exertion to start the reactor excursion.
This put the reactor on a 4-millisecond period until the core peaked at about 20
gigawatts, for a total of 130 MW-seconds of nuclear energy. [1]

Steam formed in the core and accelerated the 7-foot column of water above it at
160 feet per second towards the upper head; a 10,000 psi water hammer. The
momentum transferred to the shield plugs, which ejected at 50 feet per second,
and then lifted the entire reactor head about 9 feet up. [1]. Two of the three
men died instantly, one pinned to the ceiling by an ejected shield plug, and the
other thrown sideways onto a shield [4].

Automatic heat detection alarms were received at the fire department of the
National Reactor Testing Station around 9:01 PM MT. The AEC fire and security
teams responded but found high radiation levels of 25 r/hr and withdrew [2].
Additional staff arrived to help and realized the three men on staff must still
be in the building. The reactor floor dose rate measured 500 r/hr. Two men
decided to enter, and they saw two men, one of whom was still moving. They
withdrew and got more help. The still-living man was put on a stretcher and
removed [2], but was declared dead soon after this.

# Lessons

## Limit the rate at which control rods can be withdrawn

A control rod is thought to have been held manually by a person who then
pulled it out quickly. Later designs put rate limiting mechanisms in the
drives that prevent them from being removed rapidly.

## Don't let a single control rod be enough to go supercritical

It should take more than 1 rod to go critical from a shut down position

## Avoid water hammer

Do not put the reactor into a configuration where it has a tightly sealed
lid and a partially filled tank. If the water hammer could not have developed
the 10,000 psi pressure, this incident would not have been nearly as destructive.

# Legacy

The SL-1 accident had a major impact on nuclear safety in many ways. The
design principles were adjusted to factor in the lessons learned.
