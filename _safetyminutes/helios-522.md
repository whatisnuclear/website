# What happened?

On 15 August 2005, shortly after takeoff, air traffic control lost contact with
Helios Airways Flight 522. The flight had crashed, killing all passengers and
crew aboard (121 people), becoming the deadliest aviation accident in the
history of Greece. Investigation found that the cabin pressurization switch was
left in manual after check before takeoff, when it should have been placed back
into "auto". The warning horn for cabin pressurization sounded very similar to
another warning horn tied to take-off configuration issues.

# Lessons

1. **Close similarities in different warning signals** led to a failure to
   identify the proper cabin warning and the incapacitation of the crew due
   to hypoxia

2. Boeing had been informed of six “air pressure instances” before the Helios crash,
   but **no substantial design changes were implemented** prior to the accident.

3. Various Airworthiness Directives over the years were released to address issues related to
   pressurization, **but no directive specifically targeted the confusion** around the
   mode selector switch.

# Takeaway

The response to a known design flaw with catastrophic consequences was not
adequate to prevent a worst-case scenario from occurring. Mitigating actions
taken — such as training, documentation, and checklists — were insufficient to
prevent the accident.
