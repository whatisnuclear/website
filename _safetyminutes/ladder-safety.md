Ladders are common household tools. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, 500,000 people are treated per year from ladder-related injuries.

You can read about [how to use a ladder safely here](https://www.americanladderinstitute.org/page/BasicLadderSafety).
In summary:

- Don't use a damaged ladder; inspect it before use
- Watch out for overhead power lines
- Maintain a 3-point contact (two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand) at all times
- Stay near the middle of the ladder
- Do not use the top step as a step
- Do not use a stepladder horizontally like a platform
