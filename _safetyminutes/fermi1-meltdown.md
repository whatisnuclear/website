# What happened?

The Fermi-1 SFR had encountered some abnormal temperature measurements and
suspected a flow blockage. To investigate, they moved some assemblies around and
came to power. On October 5, 1966, at about 30% full power, radiation alarms
went off and the reactor was shut down.

Two assemblies had partially melted because the coolant flow had been 97%
obstructed from below. It was determined that a zirconium segment (installed in
a conical flow guide/core catcher in 1959 to mitigate vessel break/complete loss
of coolant) had broken off and caused the blockage.

# Lessons

1. Design your inlets to be difficult to block

2. Donâ€™t put stuff that can break off and block things in your core

3. Be able to detect flow blockage early with instrumentation and analysis

A computer system (Malfunction detection analyzer) was planned to be installed
to evaluate reactivity every 5 seconds and alert operators of any deviations (as
small as 2 cents) from expectations in power, flow rate, and inlet temperature

# Legacy

Most inlet nozzles since Fermi-1 have featured bayonet-style inlets with holes
on the sides so as to make it much more difficult geometrically for a loose part
to significantly block flow
