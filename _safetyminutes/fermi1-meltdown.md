# What happened?


The Fermi-1 SFR had encountered some abnormal temperature measurements and
suspected a flow blockage. To investigate, they moved some assemblies around and
came to power. On October 5, 1966, at about 30% full power, radiation alarms
went off and the reactor was shut down.

Two assemblies had partially melted because the coolant flow had been 97%
obstructed from below. It was determined that a zirconium segment (installed in
a conical flow guide/core catcher in 1959 to mitigate vessel break/complete loss
of coolant) had broken off and caused the blockage.

# Lessons

1. Design your inlets to be difficult to block

2. Don’t put stuff that can break off and block things in your core

3. Be able to detect flow blockage early with instrumentation and analysis

A computer system (Malfunction detection analyzer) was planned to be installed
to evaluate reactivity every 5 seconds and alert operators of any deviations (as
small as 2 cents) from expectations in power, flow rate, and inlet temperature

# Legacy

Most inlet nozzles since Fermi-1 have featured bayonet-style inlets with holes
on the sides so as to make it much more difficult geometrically for a loose part
to significantly block flow
