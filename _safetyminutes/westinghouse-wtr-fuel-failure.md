<h2>Context</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 text-start" markdown="1">
  * WTR was a pressurized tank-type water-cooled/water-moderated test reactor
  * Pressurized by head tank 250 ft. in the air
  * 60 MWt, designed to test materials and components
  * Privately owned
  * Each assembly had 200 grams of highly-enriched uranium in uranium-aluminum alloy
  * Fuel elements made of 3 concentric rings

<h2>What happened</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 text-start" markdown="1">
  * A test was planned to reduce flow and see how the reactor operated
  * Power was 40 MW and flow was 15,000 gpm
  * Power was reduced to 30 MW and safety system setpoints were adjusted
  * Flow was reduced to 5250 gpm, power increased back to 37 MW and then back to 40 MW
  * At 8:35 pm, power unexpectely dropped to 17 MW
  * Automatic control rods withdrew to upper limit
  * Power started increasing again
  * Radiation alarms! ‚ò¢Ô∏èüò±
  * Personnel scramed and secured the plant and evacuated the area

<h2>Investigation</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 text-start" markdown="1">
  * Gross fission product contamination of primary coolant
  * By April 9, the head was raised and scrubbed with carwash brushes
  * A three-inch thick shielded platform was constructed
  * Fuel was removed, but one assembly was stuck
  * It was melted
  * Coolant voiding around it explains the power reduction

<h2>Root cause</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 text-start" markdown="1">
  * Bonding defect from fuel fabrication over 1/2" found able to cause burnout
  * Inspections of spare fuel showed tons of big defects, up to 1"
  * Solution: improved fabrication tolerances and inspection
  * Blister tests insuffucient, ultrasonic inspection required
  * Cost increase of fabrication lower than cleanup costs
