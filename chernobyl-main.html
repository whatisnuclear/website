    <p>On April 26th, 1986, a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine failed violently during a
        scheduled test of the turbine system. The power of the reactor increased out of control from a
        low-power state, rapidly boiling water and causing a steam explosion that blew the roof off the the
        reactor. A graphite fire was ignited, spewing toxic radioactive substances into the atmosphere. 31
        people were killed during the accident, and it has been estimated that the released radiation has
        caused an additional 4,000 cancer deaths. </p>

    <p>Here, you can find out what caused the Chernobyl accident and why we are convinced that nothing
        like this could happen again. Check the links to the right for our collection of information on
        Chernobyl. </p>

    <h2 id="short">What happened at Chernobyl? (short version)</h2>
    <p>Because Xenon built up due to a rapid shut-down mainly caused by nearby coal plant problem,
        operators at Chernobyl retracted the control rods all the way out of the core only to notice power
        instabilities due to the inherent positive coolant void coefficient of the RBMK reactor and reinsert
        them. But the tips of the rods were graphite, which displaced water without introducing neutron
        poison, thus increasing the power rather than decreasing it and the positive void coefficient
        allowed the reactor to undergo a runaway power excursion, resulting in a catastrophic steam
        explosion and graphite fire that killed 30 workers and released radiation in levels that were soon
        detected in Finland. </p>

    <h2 id="sortof">What happened at Chernobyl? (longer version)</h2>
    <p>The Soviet government ordered the operators of Chernobyl to perform a test on their reactor. The
        test was supposed to measure how long the spinning generator would continue producing electricity
        after the reactor was shut down before it slowed and stopped. The test was to happen with the
        reactor at low power. As the operators were about to start slowly and carefully bringing the reactor
        to low power, the utility company called and said that a nearby coal plant just shut down
        unexpectedly and asked Chernobyl to stay at full power for a while longer to keep the nearby homes
        lit. After peak hours, the operators brought the plant to low power rapidly. Nuclear engineers can
        explain to you that this kind of shut-down would result in an unusually large amount of Xenon
        build-up in the reactor fuel. Xenon eats up neutrons, thus making the chain reaction more difficult
        to maintain. Because of this, the operators were surprised when the reactor went to a lower power
        than they had expected. </p>

    <p>To get the power of the reactor to its expected value, the operators pulled the control rods out
        further than they would ever do in any normal situation. Finally, the reactor went up to the power
        level needed for the test. Unfortunately, the Chernobyl reactor was designed in a dangerous manner,
        allowing the reactor to get hotter if bubbles formed in the water coolant flowing past the fuel. As
        water boiled in certain locations of the reactor, this power instability started rearing its head.
        Apparently, one of the operators noticed this highly unstable situation and pressed the button to
        insert the control rods and shut down the reactor. But, an even more serious design flaw was in the
        control rods. The neutron poison in most of each rod had a small graphite tip on the bottom. This
        graphite is not a neutron poison (and is usually beneficial to chain reactions). So with the control
        rods all the way out, inserting them for the first few inches displaced some water without
        introducing any neutron poison, and this actually increased the power of the reactor. This led to
        more boiling of the water, which resulted in even more power and then positive feedback took the
        reactor power sky-high, immediately boiling all the water to steam. The steam pressure was so great
        that it blew the lid right off the reactor and through the roof of the reactor building (which was
        not one of those steel containments, by the way. It was just a concrete building). </p>

    <p>With no more coolant, the fuel heated up and became molten. Standing graphite rods in the reactor
        ignited into a very hot graphite fire that began spewing bits of the radioactive fuel into the open
        air. The fire took over a week to extinguish, costing the lives of about 30 emergency responders due
        to acute radiation poisoning.
    </p>




    <h2 id="again">Can this happen again?</h2>

    <p>Modern reactors have reinforced steel-concrete containments domes that would not be so easily
        penetrated by a steam explosion. Control rods are designed such that all parts of them are neutron
        poisons, including the bottom. Reactors are designed to have NEGATIVE void coefficients, meaning
        boiling water would result in power decreasing automatically rather than increasing. Also, graphite
        is not typically put in reactor cores. Short answer: no.</p>
