Nuclear non-proliferation is the effort to eliminate the spread of nuclear weapon technology, and to
reduce existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Nuclear-weapon nations and their allies don't
want any other nations or entities to get the technology, and those threatened by or otherwise
hostile to these nations (or any other nations) often want to have it. Meanwhile, peaceful people
across the world want no one to have nuclear weapons.

To reach their goal, people working for non-proliferation must secure and monitor existing nuclear
weapons and weapon material, they must monitor facilities conceivably able to produce weapon
material and minimize the construction of such facilities, and they must perform political
gymnastics to minimize the allure of nuclear weapons to the world. 

## How is nuclear power tied to nuclear non-proliferation?	
The three special materials with which one can fabricate nuclear weapons are plutonium,
highly-enriched uranium, and tritium (in thermonuclear weapons). Certainly the precision
explosives and fabrication of weapons is difficult, but obtaining material is the major
hurdle. As they currently operate, most nuclear reactors are proliferation concerns for
two corresponding reasons: 

* Nuclear reactors can produce plutonium and tritium as they operate via nuclear
  reactions. These could conceivably be extracted and used for weapons.
* The enrichment plants required to fuel reactors can be operated in such a way to produce weapon
  material. 

Thus, any country with a nuclear reactor and a plutonium chemist or an enrichment plant
has access to materials which could be used to develop nuclear weapons. However, both items
have many subtleties to complicate their discussion. 


## What can be done to stop proliferation?
So, can we expand nuclear power without risking proliferation? Certainly not without being
careful.  Currently, the <a href="https://www.iaea.org">IAEA</a> (the UN nuclear watchdog)
routinely inspects nuclear facilities around the world to verify that only peaceful work
is being done. They inventory all special material very carefully. If a facility doesn't
allow inspectors in or shows signs of militarization, the political world decides what to
do. The IAEA does not have access to all of Iran's facilities nor North Korea's. Sanctions
have been issued, but we have not seen particularly drastic action on these sensitive
issues. This method of non-proliferation is called something along the lines of
"safeguards and verification."

One rather harsh non-proliferation action, called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera">Operation Opera</a>, occurred when
the Israeli Air Force bombed a nearly-completed nuclear reactor in Iraq back in 1981. This
was widely condemned by the international community.

Besides inspections and political action, there are inherent changes to the nuclear power
status-quo that can help with non-proliferation. The most mainstream change is the
establishment of an international fuel bank, where weapon states enrich and fabricate
nuclear fuel and then sell it through an internationally-controlled middleman who
guarantees its delivery to non-weapon user-states. This would keep enrichment facilities
out of the hands of new users of nuclear power.  User-nations would benefit from not
requiring the expensive front-end infrastructure of fuel fabrication, but they would
probably be slightly worried about their energy supplies in any politically turbulent
times. This idea has come under the names <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Nuclear_Energy_Partnership">GNEP</a> and, <a
href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/06/08/Obama-to-pursue-global-uranium-fuel-bank/UPI-19971244484814/">more
recently</a>, the international nuclear fuel bank.

Another option is to use a <a href="{% link thorium.md %}">thorium fuel cycle</a>, based
on natural thorium minerals rather than natural uranium. This would (at least at first)
still require enrichment or some other supply of fissile material, but it has the benefit
of not producing plutonium. It produces Uranium-233 which can also be used in weapons, though,
so this certainly isn't a perfect solution.

## Can we get rid of all nuclear weapons forever?

Technically, of course, yes we can. We can just burn the material in nuclear reactors and
convert it to electricity (we actually did this between 1993 and 2013, when 10% of US
electricity [came from dismantled Soviet
weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatons_to_Megawatts_Program)). Realistically,
however, the issue is that of Pandora's box. We now know that using 1940s technology,
nuclear weapons can be made. Even if we could somehow convince every country to destroy
their weapons (good luck keeping them from hiding just a few of them in some dark mountain
cavern, for old time's sake), we cannot forget the concept. So rather than fighting for
the eradication of nuclear weapons altogether, try rallying for the reduction of our
stockpiles from tens of thousands to about ten.

<h2>Which countries have nuclear weapons?</h2>
<div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">

Weapon states are listed here with the date of their first test in parenthesis.

* United States of America (1945)
* Russia (1949)
* United Kingdom (1952)
* France (1960)
* China (1964)
* Israel (\*suspected)
* India (1974)
* Pakistan (1998)
* North Korea (2006)

\* Israel has never actually admitted having nuclear weapons, but is widely <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/892941.stm">accused of having many [bbc]</a>. 

Several other NATO countries control nuclear weapons produced by weapon-states under the
non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Detailed discussion is found on Wikipedia's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_states">List of nuclear weapons
states</a>.

## Other aspects of non-proliferation

Besides stopping the production of weapons from nuclear reactor technology,
non-proliferation also covers some security issues such as portal monitoring. Many folks
are employed building detector systems that can scan a passing truck or shipping container
and alert the user if special nuclear material is contained inside without opening it. We
at whatisnuclear.com appreciate this massive effort, but concede that if someone were
really to put forth the effort to build a nuclear weapon, they probably wouldn't ship it
FedEx.

Yet another aspect is that of the dirty bomb. Thousands of dangerously radioactive
materials exist across the world, in hospitals, laboratories, and industries. If these
were attached to a standard bomb and set off in a populated area, the dispersed radiation
could cause serious havoc and even radiation poisoning. We have people working on
inventorying, tracking, and detecting these materials as well.
