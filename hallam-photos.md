The photos below come from the decommissioning process of the [Hallam Nuclear
Power Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallam_Nuclear_Power_Facility), a
[Sodium Graphite Reactor]({% link sodium-graphite-reactors.md
%}) that operated in Hallam, Nebraska between 1963 and 1964. Decommissioning
activities pictured here took place between 1967 and 1969. The originals are
sitting in the office at [Sheldon Power
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Power_Station). After visiting
the site and looking through the albums, I asked [Nebraska Public Power
District](https://www.nppd.com/) if they'd be willing to scan them (and [also
sponsor the digitization of a related film]({% link
_news/2023-03-13-hallam-historical-films-scanned.md %})).  They graciously
agreed and sent me the scanned PDF. Special thanks to Scott Margheim and John
McClure at NPPD for all the efforts in getting this done. We cropped the images
and transcribed the captions to get them into this form.
