title: Sodium and Salt are different in nuclear

description: > 
    While most of us think salt when we hear about sodium, the two words
    mean significantly different things in the context of advanced nuclear
    technology. This post explains the difference between salt and sodium.

Most of us use the words *sodium* and *salt* interchangeably. After all, this is how they're
used in nutrition: *low sodium* means something's not too *salty*. However, when these
terms are used in the context of nuclear technology, they refer to significantly different
concepts.

### Liquid sodium metal
Elemental sodium (Na) is a liquid metal like mercury and
solder.

Sodium metal is used as a low-pressure coolant. It transfers heat extremely well and can
keep a core cool without external power. It has been used extensively in both slow and
fast neutron reactors (i.e. SGRs and SFRs).

### Molten salt
Molten salt is made of cations and anions held in ionic bonds heated up to
flow as liquid.

Molten salts have been used as a low-pressure fluid fuel in 2 historical reactors: the ARE
and the MSRE, and is a favorite design choice for next-generation reactors due to
potential safety advantages and simplifications. They have also been proposed as the
coolant for solid-fuel reactors. Molten salt is used in nuclear concepts and in operating
solar-thermal facilities where energy can be stored for several hours as heat.

To make it even more confusing, some reactors use both sodium metal and molten salt. For
example, the [Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment) used molten salt fuel
and used sodium metal to cool the reflector. Some modern reactor concepts also
utilize both sodium metal and molten salt.

Note that while sodium metal is not in any way a salt, some salts, like Sodium-Chloride
(table salt) contain sodium. This is the sodium people refer to in nutrition. Others salts
(like Potassium-Chloride and FLiBe) do not contain any sodium.
