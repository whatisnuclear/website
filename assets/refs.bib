  abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the global energy system will require large investments in energy innovation and the deployment of new technologies. While many studies have focused on the expenditure that will be needed, here we focus on how government has spent public sector resources on innovation for a key carbon-free technology: advanced nuclear. We focus on nuclear power because it has been contributing almost 20\% of total US electric generation, and because the US program in this area has historically been the world's leading effort. Using extensive data acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, we reconstruct the budget history of the Department of Energy's program to develop advanced, non-light water nuclear reactors. Our analysis shows that---despite spending \$2 billion since the late 1990s---no advanced design is ready for deployment. Even if the program had been well designed, it still would have been insufficient to demonstrate even one non-light water technology. It has violated much of the wisdom about the effective execution of innovative programs: annual funding varies fourfold, priorities are ephemeral, incumbent technologies and fuels are prized over innovation, and infrastructure spending consumes half the budget. Absent substantial changes, the possibility of US-designed advanced reactors playing a role in decarbonization by mid-century is low.},

  abstract = {Combining Thermal Energy Storage (TES) and sodium fast reactors has been previously considered, but only at a conceptual level. This work expands on those concepts and creates a detailed engineering and system design for an integrated nuclear Thermal Energy Storage (nTES) system. The design uses General Electric-Hitachi's Power Reactor Innovative Small Module (PRISM) and combines it with a TES that uses a binary eutectic sodium and potassium nitrate salt commercially known as ``solar salt''. Beginning with a policy and economic survey, key attributes are identified that the nTES design needs to meet so that it can be economically viable in the current United States energy market. These attributes are then included in the plant design. Care was taken to ensure that common commercially available materials were used in constructing the system. The basic design was then modeled using a state space representation used to create a modern control architecture with H{$\infty$} synthesis. The control system design achieved stable salt outlet temperatures, minimal control rod motion, and a 13.3 \%/minute rate of power change under full automatic control. A detailed nodal model was created in RELAP5-3D to assess the safety implications of hybrid PRISM-nTES. The reactor performed similarly to the reference PRISM design for bounding events that did not include a Loss of Heat Sink (LOHS). In those events where a LOHS occurred, the reactor hot pool never exceeded 630 {$^\circ$}C, ensuring that structural limits for the reactor vessel were always met.},

In the early stage of commercial nuclear power, reprocessing was thought essential to supplying nuclear fuel. Federally sponsored breeder reactor development included research into advanced reprocessing technology. Several commercial interests in reprocessing foundered due to economic, technical, and regulatory issues. President Carter terminated federal support for reprocessing in an attempt to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons material. Reprocessing for nuclear weapons production ceased shortly after the Cold War ended. The Department of Energy now proposes a new generation of "proliferation-resistant" reactor and reprocessing technology.}

The fuel plates consist of a core of highly enriched UO/sub 2/ particles uniformly dispersed in a stainiess- steel matrix clad with stainiess steel. Techniques for fabricating the fuel plates are also described. The fuel plate is fabricated by hot- and cold-rolling a 3/8-inch thick sandwich assembly into the 0.030-inch thick fuel plate. The sandwich consists of a stainless steelUO/sub 2/ compact encased by a frame and two cover plates of stainless steel. Development of a non-destructive gage to detect variations of UO/sub 2/ content in the fuel core of the finished plnte and a method of attaching five-mil-diameter thermocouples to five-mil-thick fuel core cladding are noted.

Evaluation of moderate corrosion observed on aluminum parts exposed to the ML-1 shield solution indicated no loss of performance capability. Preliminary tests showed that the corrosion probably was caused by heavy metal ions or chlorides in the solution, Massive corrosion observed on the ML-1 fuel element lower spiders was attributed to sub-standard material; failure of some spiders was attributed to a combination of corrosion and sub-standard fabrication. Evaluation indicated that the upper spiders will perform satisfactorily for the design lifetime. Modification, repair, and reassembly of the CSN-1A t-c set was completed. Operation demonstrated bearing stability, but showed that the turbine effective flow area was too large. A bypass flow path in the turbine was being corrected. The TCS-670 t-c set will be stored indefinitely. Since a commercial alternator will be used for the ML-1A, further development of the brushless alternator was postponed indefinitely. Evaluation revealed that the ML-1 improved precooler design was not compatible with ML-1A requirements. Operntion of the IB-17R-2 and -3 test elements in the GETR continued without incident. Preliminary design of the ML-1A power plant was initiated. Design of modifications to the GCRE facility to adapt it to testing the ML-1 reactor skid was initiated. (auth)},

  abstract = {The Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) facility (Figure 1) was built in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and is located in the northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR facility is on high, well-drained ground, about 30 meters above the water table. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors. It was not a defense-related facility like the materials production reactors at SRS. The reactor was moderated with heavy water and was rated at 50 megawatts thermal power. In December of 1964, operations were terminated and the facility was placed in a standby condition as a result of the decision by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In 1965, fuel assemblies were removed, systems that contained heavy water were drained, fluid piping systems were drained, deenergized and disconnected and the spent fuel basin was drained and dried. The doors of the reactor facility were shut and it wasn't until 10 years later that decommissioning plans were considered and ultimately postponed due to budget constraints. In the early 1990s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR again. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and maintenance mode. The doors of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. The \$1.6 billion allocation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to SRS for site clean up at SRS has opened the doors to the HWCTR again - this time for final decommissioning. During the lifetime of HWCTR, 36 different fuel assemblies were tested in the facility. Ten of these experienced cladding failures as operational capabilities of the different designs were being established. In addition, numerous spills of heavy water occurred within the facility. Currently, radiation and radioactive contamination levels are low within HWCTR with most of the radioactivity contained within the reactor vessel. There are no known insults to the environment, however with the increasing deterioration of the facility, the possibility exists that contamination could spread outside the facility if it is not decommissioned. An interior panoramic view of the ground floor elevation taken in August 2009 is shown in Figure 2. The foreground shows the transfer coffin followed by the reactor vessel and control rod drive platform in the center. Behind the reactor vessel is the fuel pool. Above the ground level are the polar crane and the emergency deluge tank at the top of the dome. Note the considerable rust and degradation of the components and the interior of the containment building. Alternative studies have concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning is to remove the reactor vessel, steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. Characterization studies along with transport models have concluded that the remaining below grade equipment that is left in place including the transfer coffin will not contribute any significant contamination to the environment in the future. The below grade space will be grouted in place. A concrete cover will be placed over the remaining footprint and the groundwater will be monitored for an indefinite period to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The schedule for completion of decommissioning is late FY2011. This paper describes the concepts planned in order to remove the major components including the dome, the reactor vessel (RV), the two steam generators (SG), and relocating the transfer coffin (TC).},

  abstract = {Data from a survey of the literature and other available information on zirconium--uranium alloys have been reviewed for the purpose of obtaining a coherent picture of current knowledge about the properties and behavior of zirconium--uranium alloys. The results of the survey were used to revise and extend the presentation of material gathered earlier in a similar study and reported in BMI1030 in August 1955. The constitution of zirconium-uranium alloys is discussed, and a constitutional diagram for the system is presented. The effects of oxygen and nitrogen, which are present in these alloys as contaminants, on alloy constitution ars shownin the form of ternary diagrams and in terms of their quantitative effects on the phases present. The transformation kinetics and the nature of the transformation of the high-temperature body- centered-cubic gamma phase to the phases stable at room temperature are described. Two regions are discussed: in the 20 to 70 wi. \% uranium composition range, gamma, which is retained on quenching, transforms isothermally to the intermediate epsilon-phase structure by a diffusion-controlled nucleation-and- growth process; in alloys containing less than 20 wt.\% uranium, gamma transforms martensitically to a strained alpha-zirconium structure on quenching, with the diffusion-controlled transformation of gamma to either epsilon or alpha proceeding above the M/sub s/ temperature. Typical zirconium -- uranium alloy microstructures produced by working and by various heat treatments are shown, and a correlation of the structure with the manner in which it was produced and the resultant mechanical properties is attempted. Hardness, tensile, and creep data for zirconium--uranium alloys are tabulated and evaluated in terms of alloy constitution and transformation-kinetics behavior. Physical-property data for zirconium-uranium alloys are presented in tabular and graphical form. The best fabrication techniques for forging, hot and cold rolling, extruding, and swaging are detailed. The corrosion resistance of zirconium-uranium alloys in wafer at various temperatures and corrosion behavior as affected by alloy constitution are discussed. The effect of ternary additions on corrosion resistance is discussed, and pertinent data are tabulated. The influence of zircocium -uranium alloy constitution and properties on neutronirradiation behavior is discussed, and the general effects of irradiation upon these alloys are summarized. (auth)},

All sodium and fuel circuit components were made of Inconel fabricated by inert-gas (Heliarc) welding. The system was heated to design temperature by means of electrical heating units applied over all parts of the system. Instrumentation and control of the experiment were fairly conventional. For the most part, standard instruments were modified slightly for the high-temperature application.

  abstract = {Experiments are described in which measurements were made in a 35 ton mass of uranium metal. The measurements were made at site X, with the thermal neutron flux from the pile providing a source of fast neutrons in the metal. The report discusses: 1) Theory--in which a three group approximation--thermal, slow and fast--is used to derive the distribution of neutrons in a cube of metal with a source of thermal neutrons flowing into the bottom face. Expressions are derived for the relaxation length at large distances from the source, for the ratio of uranium fission to radiative capture, and for the ratio of U235 fission to U236 fission in terms of the cross sections for the various processes involved and other fundamental constants; 2) Description of experiment--a detailed description of the set-up of the pile and of the method of measurement is given; 3) Results--the results of various measurements are discussed. The measurements made consist of: a) Resonance and fission in the metal pile by means of the 23 min. U239 activity for the resonance and a catcher technique for fission. The ratio of capture to fission in the pile was found--by comparison with thermal neutrons--to be 11 {\textpm} 1; b) Iodine and indium detectors were used to explore the pile both along the axis and transversely. From these measurements the equilibrium relaxation length in an infinite mass of solid metal was found to be 9.6 cms. The indium measurements showed that the activity and indium foil far from the source was cut down by about 17\% when the foil was covered by 1/2 mm of indium, while covering with Cd had no effect; c) The fast neutron threshold detectors show that, in the metal pile, the average energy of neutrons which have suffered no collision is greater than the average energy of fission neutrons--indicating a decrease of inelastic scattering for energies above about 1 mev; d) Fission chamber measurements were made using normal, enriched and depleted U, Pu, Pa, and Th detectors. the equilibrium relaxation lengths are found to be independent of detector. The counting rates per mg. of the various detectors are compared at one position; Pu and U235 are found to have about equal fission cross sections for the equilibrium neutron distribution in the metal pile. The ratio of U235 fission to U238 fission per atom is found to be about 336 for the equilibrium neutron distribution; e) The average energy of the metal pile neutrons as measured by their slowing down range in graphite and in paraffin, is 250 {\textpm} 150 kev; 4) Discussion--The results of the various measurements are compared in detail with the theory, and a set of consistent constants for U are determined. Critical enrichment--i.e., enrichment required to make U metal chain reactions determined to correspond to a U238 to U235 ratio of 12.1.},

The isotope 210Po is a pure alpha emitter with a half-life of 138.38 days. For typical values of the neutron flux the 210Po concentration in the coolant can reach 1--10 Ci/kg. While exposure of plant personnel to Po is prevented under normal operating conditions because the primary system is sealed, Po does pose a radiological hazard during maintenance activities for which access to submerged structures is required as well as during accidents resulting in breach of the primary-system barrier. Obviously, continuous removal of Po from the LBE reduces this hazard. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which Po is formed in and released from the LBE. We summarize research performed at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate the basic chemistry of four mechanisms of Po release, which could serve as the basis for a coolant cleanup system in LBE-cooled reactors. The mechanisms explored are lead polonide evaporation, formation of polonium hydride, rare-earth filtering, and alkaline extraction. For the key chemical species involved expressions are given for useful quantities such as formation energy, release, and deposition rates. It is concluded that the most promising removal mechanism is alkaline extraction, although a more systematic investigation of this mechanism is needed.}

Decommissioning of the SRE began in 1974 with the objective of removing all significant radioactivity from the site and releasing the facility for unrestricted use. Planning documentation was prepared to describe in detail the equipment and techniques development and the decommissioning work scope. A plasma-arc manipulator was developed for remotely dissecting the highly radioactive reactor vessels. Other important developments included techniques for using explosives to cut reactor vessel internal piping, clamps, and brackets; decontaminating porous concrete surfaces; and disposing of massive equipment and structures. The documentation defined the decommissioning in an SRE dismantling plan, in activity requirements for elements of the decommissioning work scope, and in detailed procedures for each major task.},

  abstract = {Nuclear physics advances in the United States and Britain from 1939 to 1945 are described. The Manhattan Project's work led to an explosion in our knowledge of nuclear science. A conference in April 1943 at Los Alamos provided a simple formula used to compute critical masses and laid out the research program needed to determine the key nuclear constants. In short order, four university accelerators were disassembled and reassembled at Los Alamos, and methods were established to make measurements on extremely small samples owing to the initial lack of availability of enriched 235U and plutonium. I trace the program that measured fission cross sections, fission-emitted neutron multiplicities and their energy spectra, and transport cross sections, comparing the measurements with our best understanding today as embodied in the Evaluated Nuclear Data File ENDF/B-VIII.0. The large nuclear data uncertainties at the beginning of the project, which often exceeded 25\% to 50\%, were reduced by 1945 often to less than 5\% to 10\%. Uranium-235 and plutonium-239 fission cross-section assessments in the fast mega-electron-volt range were reduced following more accurate measurements, and the neutron multiplicity {$\nu$}- increased. By a lucky coincidence of canceling errors, the initial critical mass estimates were close to the final estimated masses. Some images from historical documents from our Los Alamos archives are shown. Many of the original measurements from these early years have not previously been widely available. Through this work, these data have now been archived in the international experimental nuclear reaction data library (EXFOR) in a collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Brookhaven National Laboratory.},

There was extensive damage to the Unit 4 reactor and the building that housed it. Some 31 people died as a result of the accident, either directly or as a result of receiving lethal radiation doses. A significant release of fission products occurred, contaminating land around the station and requiring the evacuation of around 135,000 people from their homes. The radioactive cloud generated over several days was carried by winds to all parts of Europe, where there was a varying degree of public concern. The contamination resulted in restrictions on the consumption of meat and vegetables. The latent health effects are, however, unlikely to be statistically significant when viewed against the normal mortality rate over the next 40 years. Although there were gross violations by the operators, the primary cause of the accident can be attributed to inherent design shortcomings in the RBMK reactor type, which is unique to the Soviet Union. The Russians have said that the accident is not possible in any commercial reactor operational outside the USSR.}

A detailed examination of the vessel was made at that time by Construction and SEP forces to check its condition before installation in Bldg. 770-U. During the past several months, the apparent defects noticed during that examination, plus any deficiencies reported before shipment, have been studied and evaluated. The only item of any consequence is concerned with the omission of a normalizing heat treatment on 21 vessel nozzles, and the effect of this omission on the impact strength of the nozzles. Another item was the damage to a welding lip during shipment of the reactor from the PACECO plant in Alameda, California to SRP. This lip permits seal welding of the vessel head to the body. This report covers a discussion of the above items as outlined under "Objectives" and presents our final conclusions and recommendations regarding the condition of the reactor vessel.

  abstract = {This 1962 film about the Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant features Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan -- who often worked for General Electric in this era -- as its narrator.  The film was shown at the plant's visitor's center for many years, touting the benefits of atomic fission and showing the inner workings of the power plant. Workers are shown looking down into the reactor where a lead covered "head" shields them from radioactivity. Beneath this head are 56 fuel bundles, containing 144 rods filled with enriched uranium pellets. The power from this single load would roughly equal that which could be generated by burning 260,000 tons of coal. Big Rock Point was a nuclear power plant near Charlevoix, Michigan. Big Rock operated from 1962 to 1997. It was owned and operated by Consumers Power, now known as Consumers Energy. Its boiling water reactor was made by General Electric (GE) and was capable of producing 67 megawatts of electricity. Bechtel Corporation was the primary contractor. Big Rock was Michigan's first nuclear power plant and the nation's fifth. It also produced Cobalt 60 for the medical industry from 1971 to 1982. Ground was broken on July 20, 1960. Construction was completed in 29 months at a cost of \$27.7 million. Its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was issued on August 29, 1962. The reactor first went critical on September 27 and the first electricity was generated on December 8, 1962. Consumers Energy had previously announced that Big Rock Point's operating license would not be renewed when it expired on May 31, 2000. However, economics proved in January 1997 that it was not feasible to keep Big Rock Point running to the license's expiration date. The reactor was scrammed for the last time on at 10:33 a.m. EDT on August 29, 1997, 35 years to the day after its license had been issued. The last fuel was removed from the core on September 20. Decontamination was completed in 1999. Because of its contributions to the nuclear and medical industries, the American Nuclear Society named Big Rock Point a Nuclear Historic Landmark. The 235,000-pound (107,000 kg) reactor vessel was removed on August 25, 2003 and shipped to Barnwell, South Carolina on October 7, 2003. All of Big Rock Point's 500-acre (200 ha), including the 130-foot (40 m) tall spherical containment structure, has been torn down. Other than eight spent fuel casks, there are no signs that the site was home to a nuclear power plant. Decommissioning costs totaled \$390,000,000.

  abstract = {The Aircrift Reactor Experiment (ARE) was oporated successfully and without untoward difficulty in November 1954. The reactor became critical with a mass of 32.8 lb of U/sup 235/, which gave a concentration of 23.9 lb of U/sup 235/ per cubic foot of fluoride fuel. For operation at power, the U/sup 235/ content of the fuel mixture was increased to 26.0 lb/ft/sup 3/, and thus the final composition of the fuel mixture was 53.09 mole\% NaF, 40.73 mole\% ZrF/sub 4/, and 6.18 mole\% UF/sub 4/. The maximum power level for sustained operation was 2.5 Mw, with a temperature gradient of 355 deg F; the maximum fuel temperature at this level was 1580 deg F. Temperatures as high as 1620 deg F were recorded during transients. From the time the reactor first went critical until the final shutdown, 221 hr had elapsed, and for the final 74 hr the power was in the megawatt range (0.1 to 2.5 Mw). The total integrated power was about 96 Mw-hr. While at power the reactor exhibited excellent stability and it was easily controlled because of its high negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, which made the reactor a slave to the load placed upon it. The fuel temperature coefficient was -9.8 x 10/sup -5/ ( DELTA k/k)/ deg F, and the over-all coefficient for the reactor was -6.1 x 10/sup -5/. Practically all the gaseous fission products and probably some of the other volatile fission products were removed from the circulating fuel. In a 25-hr run at 2.12 Mw the upper limit of the reactor poisoning due to xenon was 0.01\% DELTA k/k. No more than 5\% of the xenon stayed in the molten fluoride fuel. The total time of operation at high temperature (l000 to 1600 deg F) for the sodium circuit was 635 hr, and, for the fluoride fuel system, 462 hr. During most of the operating period the sodium was circulated at 150 gpm nnd the fuel at 46 gpm. The fabricability and compatibility of the materials system, i.e., fluoride fuel, stadium coolant, and lnconel structure, were demonstrated, at least for the operating times, temperatures, and flux levels present. All components and, with few exceptions, all instrumentation performed according to design specifications. The performance of the pumps was particularly gratifying, and the low incidence of instrumentation failure was remarkable in view of the quantity and complexity of the instruments used. (auth)},

The General Atomic assessment included only the nuclear reactor portion of the nuclear plant. United Engineers and Constructors Inc. (UE and C) was requested by the USAEC in November 1974 to prepare an economic comparison of the three conceptual plants. The comparison is divided into three tasks: (1) Develop a balance of plant conceptual design to be combined with the General Atomic concept as a basis for comparison, and estimate the cost of the General Atomic/UE and C concept in July 1974 dollars; (2) Normalize the overall plant costs for the General Atomic/UE and C, General Electric and Westinghouse concepts, compare the costs, and identify significant differences between the concepts; and (3) Estimate the operation and maintenance costs for the General Atomic/UE and C plant and compare with the other concepts. The results of these task studies are discussed.},

For most of this period the nuclear industry in the United States was the world leader in commercial nuclear PWR power plants and the evolution of PWRs in the world closely parallels the evolution in the United States. The Shippingport Nuclear Power Plant achieved its first core criticality on December 2, 1957. Since then there have been generation I, generation II, generation III and generation III~+~reactor designs developed and implemented. The article also addresses the development of pressurized water small modular reactors. The power output of the reactor has ranged from about 45 MWe for the SMR to over 1600 MWe for the current French EPR design. Plant safety systems have evolved from single failure tolerance systems to probabilistic approaches that have four separate safety divisions plus additional diverse non-safety systems and controls which dramatically decrease the probability of possible impacts on the public. The Three Mile Island nuclear accident is discussed and evaluated for its impact on the design of Pressurized Water Reactors. The more recent developments of passive safety systems enable reactors to dramatically decrease their reliance on AC power.},

These irradiations and fuel development are being accomplished to support development of the next generation reactors in the United States. The experiments will be irradiated over the next several years to demonstrate and qualify new TRISO coated particle fuel for use in high temperature gas reactors. The goals of the experiments are to provide irradiation performance data to support fuel process development, to qualify fuel for normal operating conditions, to support development and validation of fuel performance and fission product transport models and codes, and to provide irradiated fuel and materials for post irradiation examination (PIE) and safety testing. The experiments, which will each consist of several independent capsules, will be irradiated in an inert sweep gas atmosphere with individual on-line temperature monitoring and control of each capsule. The sweep gas will also have on-line fission product monitoring on its effluent to track performance of the fuel in each individual capsule during irradiation. The first experiment (designated AGR-1) started irradiation in December 2006 and was completed in November 2009. The second experiment (AGR-2) started irradiation in June 2010 and completed in October 2013. The third and fourth experiments have been combined into a single experiment designated (AGR-3/4), which started its irradiation in December 2011 and completed in April 2014. Since the purpose of this experiment was to provide data on fission product migration and retention in the NGNP reactor, the design of this experiment was significantly different from the first two experiments, though the control and monitoring systems are very similar. The final experiment, AGR-5/6/7, is scheduled to begin irradiation in early summer 2017.},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine some of the limits to large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) in traditional electric power systems. Specifically, we evaluate the ability of PV to provide a large fraction (up to 50\%) of a utility system's energy by comparing hourly output of a simulated large PV system to the amount of electricity actually usable. The simulations use hourly recorded solar insolation and load data for Texas in the year 2000 and consider the constraints of traditional electricity generation plants to reduce output and accommodate intermittent PV generation. We find that under high penetration levels and existing grid-operation procedures and rules, the system will have excess PV generation during certain periods of the year. Several metrics are developed to examine this excess PV generation and resulting costs as a function of PV penetration at different levels of system flexibility. The limited flexibility of base load generators produces increasingly large amounts of unusable PV generation when PV provides perhaps 10--20\% of a system's energy. Measures to increase PV penetration beyond this range will be discussed and quantified in a follow-up analysis.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of transient and steady state boiling in a water-cooled, water-moderated reactor have been investigated in a reactor which was set up and operated at the Reactor Testing Station during the Summer and Fall of 1953. In a s e r i e s of about 70 intentional "runaway" type t e s t s it was demonstrated that the formation of steam and consequent ejection of water from the reactor core can provide inherent protection against the runaway hazard in suitably designed r e a c t o r s of the water -cooled, water -moderated (HJO or D2O) type. Power excursions of periods as short as 0.005 second (2.1\% excess reactivity in the experimental reactor) were terminated by this process. Although the maximum power in the excursions went a s high a s 2600 megawatts, fuel plate temperature never exceeded 640F. Maximum power, total energy liberation, and fuel plate temperatures were investigated at atmospheric p r e s s u r e as functions of excess reactivity in the excursion and initial reactor temperature. Operation of the reactor in steady boiling at p r e s sures up to 130 psig and powers up to 1200 kw demonstrated that quite smooth operation is attainable up to the pointwhere the steam content of the reactor represents about -2\% kgff in reactivity. At higher s t e am contents c h a r a c t e r i s t i c power fluctuations were observed. The reactor steam power was shown to be self-regulating. The effects of various operating conditions and system variables on reactor power and operating characteristics were investigated. Results of the investigation are believed to point the way toward more economical power reactors through minimization of the hazard problem, simplification of reactor design, and reduction of the temperature demands on reactor material s .},

  abstract = {The availability of uranium drives the future of the nuclear energy industry; an upper limit on uranium prices will determine whether it is economically viable to continue utilising the present generation of light water reactors (LWRs). The alternative is a move towards fast reactors, which use less uranium than LWRs, however require substantial investment and development, and might never become economically viable unless uranium prices rise considerably. While terrestrial uranium resources are seen to be limited, there are approximately 4 billion tonnes of uranium in seawater and although uranium only exists at concentrations of around 3.3~ppb, selective extraction has been achieved. Even though several thorough cost estimates of the extraction process have been undertaken, the practicality of the process and the scale on which it would need to be deployed to sustain the nuclear industry is still questionable. This review aims to examine some of the limitations of the current favourite amidoxime braid system, as well as examining possible interactions with existing legal frameworks which have been put in place; in particular those protecting the marine environment. The potential for uranium extraction from seawater is clearly vast, together with the consequences for nuclear technology choices - but the implications of deploying the technology on such a large scale must be considered.},

  abstract = {Address by Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, to the 470th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, 8 December 1953, 2:45 p.m.General Assembly President: Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (India) Madam President and Members of the General Assembly, When Secretary General Hammarskjold's invitation to address the General Assembly reached me in Bermuda, I was just beginning a series of conferences with the prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and France. Our subject was some of the problems that beset our world. During the remainder of the Bermuda Conference, I had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honour. That honour is mine today as I stand here, privileged to address the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you, I have a sense of exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly. Never before in history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization. Your deliberations and decisions during these sombre years have already realized part of those hopes. But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead. And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, I would use the office which, for the time being, I hold, to assure you that the Government of the United States will remain steadfast in its support of this body. This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom, of the courage and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations, and happiness and well-being for all men. Clearly, it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral American report on Bermuda. Nevertheless, I assure you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched in your Charter. Neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity to recite, however hopefully, pious platitudes. I therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates, and on mine, for a great many months: thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American people. I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all. Finally, if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure the tensions of today's world, what more appropriate audience could there be than the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new, one which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use. That new language is the language of atomic warfare. The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension, at least in comparative terms, of the extent of this development, of the utmost significance to every one of us.Clearly, if the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace, they must be armed with the significant facts of today's existence. My recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United States terms, for these are the only incontrovertible facts that I know, I need hardly point out to this Assembly, however, that this subject is global, not merely national in character. On 16 July 1945, the United States set off the world's biggest atomic explosion. Since that date in 1945, the United States of America has conducted forty-two test explosions. Atomic bombs are more than twenty-five times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned, while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT equivalent. Today, the United States stockpile of atomic weapons, which, of course,increases daily, exceeds by many times the total equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all the years of the Second World War. A single air group whether afloat or land based, can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all the Second World War. In size and variety, the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable. The development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status within our armed services. In the United States,the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps are all capable of putting this weapon to military use. But the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic might are not ours alone. In the first place, the secret is possessed by our friends and allies, the United Kingdom and Canada, whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries and the designs of atomic bombs. The secret is also known by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has informed us that, over recent years, it has devoted extensive resources to atomic weapons. During this period the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic devices, including at least one involving thermo-nuclear reactions. If at one time the United States possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power, that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago.Therefore, although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great quantitative advantage, the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater significance. First, the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others, possibly all others. Second, even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons, and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself, against the fearful material damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression. The free world, at least dimly aware of these facts, has naturally embarked on a large programme of warning and defence systems. That programme will be accelerated and extended. But let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defence can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation. The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb doesn't permit of any such easy solution. Even against the most powerful defence,an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs fora surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets to cause hideous damage. Should such an atomic attack be launched against the United States, our reactions would be swift and resolute. But for me to say that the defence capabilities of the United States are such that they could inflict terrible losses upon an aggressor, for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the United States are so great that such an aggressor's land would be laid waste, all this, while fact, is not the true expression of the purpose and the hopes of the United States. To pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world. To stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of civilization destroyed, the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind handed down to us from generation to generation, and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagery towards decency, and right, and justice. Surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation. Could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history with such human degradation and destruction?Occasional pages of history do record the faces of the "great destroyers", but the whole book of history reveals mankind's never-ending quest for peace and mankind's God-given capacity to build. It is with the book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the United States will ever wish to be identified. My country wants to be constructive,not destructive. It wants agreements, not wars, among nations. It wants itself to live in freedom and in the confidence that the peoples of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life. So my country's purpose is to help us to move out of the dark chamber of horrors into the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, the souls of men everywhere, can move forward towards peace and happiness and well-being. In this quest, I know that we must not lack patience. I know that in a world divided, such as ours today, salvation cannot be attained by one dramatic act.I know that many steps will have to be taken over many months before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world. But I know, above all else, that we must start to take these steps - now. The United States and its allies, the United Kingdom and France, have over the past months tried to take some of these steps. Let no one say that we shun the conference table. On the record has long stood the request of the United States, the United Kingdom and France to negotiate with the Soviet Union the problems of a divided Germany. On that record has long stood the request of the same three nations to negotiate an Austrian peace treaty. On the same record still stands the request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea. Most recently we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect an expression of willingness to hold a four-Power meeting. Along with our allies,the United Kingdom and France, we were pleased to see that this note did not contain the unacceptable pre-conditions previously put forward. As you already know from our joint Bermuda communique, the United States, the United Kingdom and France have agreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union. The Government of the United States approaches this conference with hopeful sincerity. We will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose of emerging from that conference with tangible results towards peace, the only true way of lessening international tension. We never have, and never will, propose or suggest that the Soviet Union surrender what rightly belongs to it. We will never say that the peoples of the USSR are an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship. On the contrary, we hope that this coming conference may initiate a relationship with the Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a freer mingling of the peoples of the East and of the West - the one sure, human way of developing the understanding required for confident and peaceful relations. Instead of the discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany,occupied Austria and the countries of Eastern Europe, we seek a harmonious family of free European nations, with none a threat to the other, and least of all a threat to the peoples of the USSR. Beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of Asis, we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural resources and to elevate their lot. These are not idle words or shallow visions. Behind them lies a story of nations lately come to independence, not as a result of war, but through free grant or peaceful negotiation. There is a record already written of assistance gladly given by nations of the West to needy peoples and to those suffering the temporary effects of famine, drought and natural disaster. These are deeds of peace. They speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent. But I do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or the restatement of past deeds. The gravity of the time is such that every new avenue of peace, no matter how dimly discernible, should be explored. There is at least one new avenue of peace which has not been well explored -an avenue now laid out by the General Assembly of the United Nations. In its resolution of 28 November 1953 (resolution 715 (VIII)) this General Assembly suggested: "that the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing a sub-committee consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved, which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report...on such a solution to the General Assembly and to the Security Council not later than 1 September 1954. The United States, heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of the United Nations, is instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may be "principally involved", to seek "an acceptable solution" to the atomic armaments race which overshadows not only the peace, but the very life, of the world. We shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception. The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace. The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build-up can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon, for the benefit of all mankind. The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future. The capability,already proved, is here today. Who can doubt that, if the entire body of the world's scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with which to test and develop their ideas, this capability would rapidly be transformed into universal, efficient and economic usage? To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds the people and the governments of the East and West, there are certain steps that can be taken now. I therefore make the following proposal. The governments principally involved, to the extent permitted by elementary prudence, should begin now and continue to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international atomic energy agency. We would expect that such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the United Nations. The ratios of contributions, the procedures and other details would properly be within the scope of the "private conversations" I referred to earlier. The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith.Any partner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find the United States a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate. Undoubtedly, initial and early contributions to this plan would be small in quantity. However, the proposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world-wide inspection and control. The atomic energy agency could be made responsible for the impounding,storage and protection of the contributed fissionable and other materials. The ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure. The more important responsibility of this atomic energy agency would be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind. Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic energy to the needs of agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities. A special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the world. Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind. The United States would be more than willing - it would be proud to take up with others "principally involved" the development of plans whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedited. Of those "principally involved" the Soviet Union must, of course, be one. I would be prepared to submit to the Congress of the United States, and with every expectation of approval, any such plan that would, first, encourage world-wide investigation into the most effective peacetime uses of fissionable material, and with the certainty that the investigators had all the material needed for the conducting of all experiments that were appropriate; second,begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the world's atomic stockpiles; third, allow all peoples of all nations to see that, in this enlightened age, the great Powers of the earth, both of the East and of the West, are interested in human aspirations first rather than in building up the armaments of war; fourth, open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiative at least a new approach to the many difficult problems that must be solved in both private and public conversations if the world is to shake off the inertia imposed by fear and is to make positive progress towards peace. Against the dark background of the atomic bomb, the United States does not wish merely to present strength, but also the desire and the hope for peace.The coming months will be fraught with fateful decisions. In this Assembly, in the capitals and military headquarters of the world, in the hearts of men everywhere, be they governed or governors, may they be the decisions which will lead this world out of fear and into peace. To the making of these fateful decisions, the United States pledges before you, and therefore before the world, its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma - to devote its entire heart and mind to finding the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life. I again thank representatives for the great honour they have done me in inviting me to appear before them and in listening to me so graciously.},

Currently, the EEDB contains 6 nuclear electrical generating plant technical models and 5 comparison coal-fired electrical generating plant technical models. Each of these technical plant models is a complete conceptual design for a single unit, steam electric power generating station located on a standard, hypothetical Middletown site. A description of the site is provided in Appendix A-1 (Volume 2) for nuclear plants, and Appendix A-2 (Volume 2) for coal-fired plants. The EEDB also includes a conceptual design of a coal liquefaction plant for comparison purposes. Volume 1 provides a description of the current Data Base, as of September 30, 1978: gives assumptions and ground rules for the initial-cost update; summarizes the initial cost update, with cost results tabulated; details the initial update of the technical conceptual design, the capital cost, the quantities of commodities and their unit costs, and craft labor man hours and costs for each EEDB program model; and details the fuel-cycle-cost initial update and the operating- and maintenance-cost initial update.

For the latter, the previous emphasis has been on breeding performance and low fissile inventory to help limit the demand on nonrenewable natural resources (uranium) in an expanding nuclear economy; little or no thought has been given to alternative uses of nuclear fuels such as proliferation of nuclear explosives. As a consequence, the conceptual designs that evolved (e.g., the ORNL reference design MSBR) all favored enriched /sup 233/U as fuel with an on-site chemical processing facility from which portions of that fuel could be diverted fairly easily. With the current interest in limiting the proliferation potential of nuclear electric power systems, a redirected study of MSRs was undertaken in an effort to identify conceptual systems that would be attractive in this situation. It appears that practical proliferation-resistant MSRs could be designed and built, and the report describes a particularly attractive break-even breeder that includes an on-site chemical reprocessing facility within the reactor primary containment.},

Similar results were obtained on several elements by other experimenters using {$\alpha$}-particles, and artificially accelerated protons and deutons.},

The present discussion is primarily in the context of the needs of the fast breeder reactor. More generally, it is pointed out that gas cooling allows full utilization of the most modern steam plant development, with substantial advantages both to plant cost and efficiency. It also makes feasible the intergral PCRV type of construction. The prospect of future combination with the gas turbine offers a unique field for future reduction of plant cost.},

A half-scale mockup of the reactor vessel was designed and constructed to verity experimentally the results of the theoretical hydraulic analysis. Physics calculations have allowed the selection of core parameters and have indicated that about 545 g of thoria (containing 10\% of 93\%-enriched urania) per kg of water is required for design power at 10.2-atm saturation pressure. An initial hazards analysis has shown that SLUBREX can be operated safely at the proposed site near EBR-II at the National Reactor Testing Station.

The net strategic value of the nuclear material associated with reactor operation is evaluated for a variety of enrichment levels, ranging from slightly enriched to weapon-grade fuel. To quantify the proliferation potential, both the demand of fresh uranium fuel as well as the plutonium buildup in the irradiated fuel are estimated via cell burnup calculations. The analysis confirms the usefulness of the current enrichment limit and challenges a recent trend to reconsider fuel enrichment levels between 20\% and 50\% for new research reactor projects.

ZEEP represented the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction in Canada, and the first outside the U.S.A. It launched the country on the road to CANDU, considered by most experts as the best power reactor system in the world. In 1942 it was decided to move the UK Nuclear Energy Program to Canada, and a joint Canada-UK laboratory was set up in Montreal. The work in Montreal led to the decision in 1944 to build a natural uranium fuelled, heavy-water moderated reactor (NRX). The construction of ZEEP was completed by September 4, 1945 and the reactor went critical on September 5, 1945, only 16 months after conception. Many valuable experiments were done in ZEEP during its final period of operation from 1957 to shut down on July 27, 1970. Some of the more significant experiments were recalled, among them the measurement of the reactivity of several NRU fuel assemblies, a comparison of the neutron absorption of samples of zircaloy, ZR-NB and ozhennite, irradiation of sulphur capsules for the commercial products division of AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited) to explore ways to enhance the production of P-32, tests of self-powered flux detectors, and the reactivity of Douglas point type fuel bundles for the CANDU reactor in India. 6 ills.},

Special attention is paid to the role of the Radium Office of the Institute of Public Health in Rome in providing to Fermi the ``radium emanation'' (Radon-222) used to make his radon-beryllium neutron sources. This particular angle of investigation allows us to make a full reconstruction of what Fermi actually realized in his laboratory, to gain a better insight into his methodological choices, and, ultimately, to understand how special circumstances conspired to make the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity possible.},

The position of the 60 metre meteorological tower near the bore-hole was measured in 1977 and 1986 with satellite navigation equipment. These measurements show a surface velocity of 3.5 m/yr {\textpm} 0.2 m/yr in the direction 235{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 2{$^\circ$}. Measurement of the surface topography in 1986 shows the bore-hole is situated on a local sloping ice divide. A differential magnetometer was used to locate the drill tower. Hand augering verified the location and showed the drill tower was buried 6.5 to 7 m beneath the 1986 snow surface, as expected from the depth-age relation. The casing was not identified. Extension of the casing to the snow surface and resurvey of the borehole will provide urgently needed information on the variation of ice flow with depth.},

The approach taken to satisfy the escalating safety concerns has resulted in excessively complex and expensive plant designs but has failed to create public confidence. This paper describes a new approach based on the principle of Process Inherent Ultimate Safety (PIUS). With the PIUS principle, ultimate safety is obtained by guaranteeing core integrity under all credible conditions. This is accomplished on the basis of the laws of gravity and thermohydraulics alone, interacting with the heat extraction process in an intact or damaged primary circuit, without recourse to engineered safety systems that may fail or dependence on error-prone human intervention. Application of the PIUS principle to the pressurized water reactor involves a substantial redesign of the reactor and primary system but builds on established PWR technology where long-term operation is needed for verification.},

  abstract = {The MSRE is an 8-MW(th) reactor in which molten fluoride salt at 1200{$^\circ$}F circulates through a core of graphite bars. Its purpose was to demonstrate the practicality of the key features of molten-salt power reactors. Operation with 235U (33\% enrichment) in the fuel salt began in June 1965, and by March 1968 nuclear operation amounted to 9000 equivalent full-power hours. The goal of demonstrating reliability had been attained---over the last 15 months of 235U operation the reactor had been critical 80\% of the time. At the end of a 6-month run which climaxed this demonstration, the reactor was shut down and the 0.9 mole\% uranium in the fuel was stripped very efficiently in an on-site fluorination facility. Uranium-233 was then added to the carrier salt, making the MSRE the world's first reactor to be fueled with this fissile material. Nuclear operation was resumed in October 1968, and over 2500 equivalent full-power hours have now been produced with 233U. The MSRE has shown that salt handling in an operating reactor is quite practical, the salt chemistry is well behaved, there is practically no corrosion, the nuclear characteristics are very close to predictions, and the system is dynamically stable. Containment of fission products has been excellent and maintenance of radioactive components has been accomplished without unreasonable delay and with very little radiation exposure. The successful operation of the MSRE is an achievement that should strengthen confidence in the practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept.},

Comparisons were made of hot- and coldmoderator reactors and of the relative merits of pressuretube and pressure-vessel designs. Reactors cooled with liquid D/sub 2/O, boiling D/sub 2/O, /sub 2/O steam, and helium were evalunted. A cold-moderator pressure-tube reactor cooled with boiling D/sub 2/O shows the most economic promise of the D/sub 2/Omoderated reactor systems studied to date. Reactors of this type have sufficient reactivity to permit satisfactory fuel exposures, but the development of additional technology is a prerequisite for optimum designs. At capacities of 300 and 400 Mw(e), the estimated power costs from the current designs of boiling-D/sub 2/O pressure-tabe reactor plants are 11.3 and 9.8 mills/kwh, respectively. From liquid-D/sub 2/-cooled concepts of comparable capacities the indicated power costs are 7 to 20\% higher.

  abstract = {The Compact Sodium-cooled Nuclear Reactor Facility (KNK) was an experimental nuclear power plant of 20 MW electric power erected on the premises of the Karlsruhe Research Center. The plant was initially run as KNK I with a thermal core between 1971 and 1974 and then, between 1977 and 1991, with a fast core as the KNK II fast breeder plant. Under the decommissioning concept, the plant is to be decommissioned completely to green field conditions at the end of 2005 in ten steps, i.e. under the corresponding ten decommissioning permits. To this day, nine decommissioning permits have been issued, the first one in 1993 and the most recent one, number nine, in 2001. The decommissioning and demolition activities covered by decommissioning permits 1 to 7 have been completed. Under the 8th Decommissioning Permit, the components of the primary system and the rotating reactor top shield are to be removed by late 2001. Under the 9th Decommissioning Permit, the reactor vessel with its internals, the primary shield, and the biological shield are to be dismantled. The residual sodium volume in the reactor vessel was estimated to amount to approx. 30 l. The maximum Co-60 activation is on the order of 107-108 Bq/g; the maximum dose rate in the middle of the vessel was measured in April 1997 to be 55 Sv/h. The difficulty involved especially in dismantling KNK, on the one hand, is posed by the residual sodium in the plant, which determines the choice of neither wet nor thermical techniques to be used in disassembly. Another difficulty is caused by the depth of activation by fast neutrons, as a result of which not only the reactor vessel proper, but also the entire primary shield (60 cm of grey cast iron) and large parts of the biological shield must be disassembled and disposed of under remote control.},

Removal of the reactor pressure vessel was an unusually difficult problem, and an extraordinary, unexpected amount of activated rock and soil was removed. After removal of all significantly contaminated material, the site consisted of a 20-ft deep excavation surrounded by backfill material. Before this excavation was backfilled, it and the backfill material were radiologically surveyed and detailed records made of these surveys. After the excavation was backfilled and graded, the site surface was surveyed again and found to be essentially uncontaminated.},

  abstract = {A consistent set of designs for 1000 MWt commercial-scale sodium-cooled Advance Burner Reactors (ABR) have been developed for both metal and oxide-fueled cores with conversion ratios from breakeven (CR=1.0) to fertile-free (CR=0.0). These designs are expected to satisfy thermal and irradiation damage limits based on the currently available data. The very low conversion ratio designs require fuel that is beyond the current fuel database, which is anticipated to be qualified by and for the Advanced Burned Test Reactor. Safety and kinetic parameters were calculated, but a safety analysis was not performed. Development of these designs was required to achieve the primary goal of this study, which was to generate representative fuel cycle mass flows for system studies of ABRs as part of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). There are slight variations with conversion ratio but the basic ABR configuration consists of 144 fuel assemblies and between 9 and 22 primary control assemblies for both the metal and oxide-fueled cores. Preliminary design studies indicated that it is feasible to design the ABR to accommodate a wide range of conversion ratio by employing different assembly designs and including sufficient control assemblies to accommodate the large reactivity swing at low conversion ratios. The assemblies are designed to fit within the same geometry, but the size and number of fuel pins within each assembly are significantly different in order to achieve the target conversion ratio while still satisfying thermal limits. Current irradiation experience would allow for a conversion ratio of somewhat below 0.75. The fuel qualification for the first ABR should expand this experience to allow for much lower conversion ratios and higher bunrups. The current designs were based on assumptions about the performance of high and very high enrichment fuel, which results in significant uncertainty about the details of the designs. However, the basic fuel cycle performance trends such as conversion ratio and mass flow parameters are less sensitive to these parameters and the current results should provide a good basis for static and dynamic system analysis. The conversion ratio is fundamentally a ratio of the macroscopic cross section of U-238 capture to that of TRU fission. Since the microscopic cross sections only change moderately with fuel design and isotopic concentration for the fast reactor, a specific conversion ratio requires a specific enrichment. The approximate average charge enrichment (TRU/HM) is 14\%, 21\%, 33\%, 56\%, and 100\% for conversion ratios of 1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.0 for the metal-fueled cores. The approximate average charge enrichment is 17\%, 25\%, 38\%, 60\%, and 100\% for conversion ratios of 1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.0 for the oxide-fueled core. For the split batch cores, the maximum enrichment will be somewhat higher. For both the metal and oxide-fueled cores, the reactivity feedback coefficients and kinetics parameters seem reasonable. The maximum single control assembly reactivity faults may be too large for the low conversion ratio designs. The average reactivity of the primary control assemblies was increased, which may cause the maximum reactivity of the central control assembly to be excessive. The values of the reactivity coefficients and kinetics parameters show that some values appear to improve significantly at lower conversion ratios while others appear far less favorable. Detailed safety analysis is required to determine if these designs have adequate safety margins or if appropriate design modifications are required. Detailed system analysis data has been generated for both metal and oxide-fueled core designs over the entire range of potential burner reactors. Additional data has been calculated for a few alternative fuel cycles. The systems data has been summarized in this report and the detailed data will be provided to the systems analysis team so that static and dynamic system analyses can be performed.},

Fuel swelling, mechanical and chemical interactions with various cladding materials, performance during transients, failure mechanisms, and behavior following both benign and complete failure of fuel pins have been extensively studied. The basic phenomena governing the performance of this type of fuel are well known, and have been sufficiently well modeled to specify design parameters that will assure reliable performance.},

  abstract = {At the beginning of 1963 nuclear power plants produced some 3 500 000kW of electrical power to different distribution grids around the world Much significant operating experience has been gained with these power reactors, but this experience is often not collected in such a way as to make it easily available The International Atomic Energy Agency convened a Conference on Operating Experience with Power Reactors in Vienna from 4-8 June 1963 which was attended by 240 participants representing 27 of the Agency's Member States and six international organizations At the Conference, 42 papers giving detailed experience with more than 20 nuclear power stations were discussed Although similar meetings on a national or regional scale have been held earlier in various countries, this is the first arranged by the Agency on a world-wide basis Some of the detailed material may have been given earlier but for the most part it represents new and recently acquired experience, and for the first time it has been possible to compile in one place such extensive material on the operating experience with power reactors The Conference discussed the experience gained both generally in the context of national and international nuclear power development programmes, and more specifically in the detailed operating experience with different power reactor stations In addition, various plant components, fuel cycles, staffing of nuclear plants and licensing of such staff were treated It is hoped that these Proceedings will be of interest not only to nuclear plant designers and operators who daily encounter problems similar to those discussed by the Conference, but also to those guiding the planning and implementation of power development programmes},

  abstract = {single unit with the abililty to pump highly radioactive sodium (10/sup 8/ Mev/(cm/sup 3/) (sec) at high temperature (800 deg C) is described. The unit components are aligned vertically to reduce the electrical conductor length between homopolar generator and pump. The entire structure, including the 1250- hp drive motor is 30 ft high and weighs 35 tons. The pump is designed to develop a head of 75 psi at a pumping rate of 10,000 gpm. At this rate the generator must deliver 250,000 amp at 2.5 v. The low-voltage requirement of the pump permits the use of flat sheet insulation of pure mica or ceramic. The pump is limited in temperature by the curie point of iron (763 deg C). The homopolar generator is of the liquid brush type: eutectic NaK serves as the current- conductor between the rotating and stationary members. There are no windings in the machine other per strap. The essence of the pump-power supply unit lies in its ability to convert 2300-volt, 3-phase electrical power to controllable sodium pumping. Tests on the unit have revealed many interesting results which will aid greatly in the design of advanced models. (auth) Performacne tests are being conducted on two prootype 5000-gpm sodium pumps for application in the primary and secondary heat transfer systems of the EBR-II. Both pumps, one electromagnetic and one mechanical, have operated more than 5500 hr in sodium at temperatures whcih chave exceeded 800 deg F. The pump designs and test facilities are descrbied.

The use of this plant for the contemplated experimental work would involve lower capital costs than the use of other facilities at DOE sites, except possibly for spiking of recovered products; the operating costs would be no greater than at other sites. The work on reprocessing of alternative fuels and coprocessing could commence within about one year; on recovery of radioactive gases, in 3 to 5 years; on spiking, in 4 years; and on waste solidification demonstration, in about 5 years. The contemplated work could be begun at this plant at least as early as at Barnwell, although work on spiking of recovered products could probably be started in existing hot cells earlier than at West Valley.

Sixteen of the twenty-three gloveboxes which comprised the system were disassembled and relocated for reuse or placed into controlled storage during 1974 but, due to funding constraints, full-scale decommissioning did not start until 1978. Since that time the fourteen remaining contaminated gloveboxes, including all internal and external equipment as well as the associated ventilation systems, have been assayed for radioactive content, dismantled, size reduced to fit acceptable packaging and sent to a US Department of Energy (DOE) transuranic retrievable-storage site or to a DOE low-level nuclear waste burial ground. The project which was completed in 1983, required 5 years to accomplish, 32 man years of effort, produced some 540 cubic meters (19,000 cubic ft) of radioactive waste of which 60\% was TRU, and cost 2.4 million dollars.},

  abstract = {The outlook for nuclear power in the U.S. is currently very bright. The economics, operations and safety performance of U.S. nuclear power plants is excellent. In addition, both the safety and economic regulation of nuclear power are being changed to produce better economic parameters for future nuclear plant operations and the licenses for plant operations are being extended to 60 years. There is further a growing awareness of the value of clean, emissions-free nuclear power. These parameters combine to form a firm foundation for continued successful U.S. nuclear plant operations, and even the potential for new plant construction.},

  abstract = {The first commercial application of a high temperature gas-cooled reactor presented some rather unique functional and material requirements for the control rod system mechanical components. Reactor core geometry and coolant temperature distribution required the control rod drives to be located below the reactor vessel and to operate against gravity for shutting down the reactor. High temperature, high radiation, and the characteristic inertness of the helium coolant imposed operating conditions on materials and lubricants for which little or no previous operating and test experience existed. This paper covers the philosophy behind the design, a description of the equipment and its operation, and a description of the research and development program. Since this equipment has been exposed to both low- and fullpower reactor operation, a portion of this paper deals with the experience encountered in these areas. Significantly useful information was derived in the area of material combinations and component lubrication under unusual environmental conditions. The application of a hydraulic motor as the motive power source for the control rods resulted in the development of a unique and releable mechanism for automatically decelerating a high velocity shaft rotation at a fixed limit of revolutions.},

Fission gas bubbles are assumed to nucleate isotropically from gas atoms in the metallic fuel matrix since they could nucleate at both the grain boundaries and the phase boundaries, which are randomly distributed inside the grain. Bubbles can grow to larger sizes by gas atom diffusion and coalescence with other bubbles. When bubble density or swelling due to bubbles reaches a threshold value, bubbles are assumed to be interconnected to each other to form an open channel to the external free space and then the fission gases inside the interconnected open bubbles are released instantaneously. During the irradiation, fission gases are successively released through the open bubbles. The GRSIS model was validated by comparison with the irradiation test results of U--Pu--10Zr fuels as well as parametric studies of the key variables in the model.},

The matrix further identifies the estimated incremental cost to a 600 MWe PHWR that would be required to license the plant in the U. S.

  abstract = {The used fuel discharged from nuclear power plants constitutes the main contribution to nuclear waste in countries which do not undertake reprocessing. As such, its disposal requires isolation from the biosphere in stable deep geological formations for long periods of time (some hundred thousand years) until its radioactivity decreases through the process of radioactive decay. Ways for significantly reducing the volumes and radiotoxicities of the waste and to shorten the very long times for which the waste must be stored safely are being investigated. This is the motivation behind the partitioning and transmutation (P and T) activities worldwide. This paper addresses the potential impact of P and T on the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. In particular, it evaluates how realistic P and T scenarios can lead to a reduction in the time required for the waste to be stored safely. The calculations have been done independently by three research groups: ITU and FZK in Germany, and by the CEA in France. (author)},

  abstract = {Nuclear power will be needed for future energy demands, which are expected to grow at different rates around the world. The opportunities for building new nuclear power plants around the world will be depend on need, energy demand growth, and issues related to global warming and climate change. However, four major barriers exist for the expansion of nuclear power: economics, proliferation, safety, and wate. These issues must be addressed in the ongoing research and development of nuclear energy technology and applications. The evolution of nuclear power plant technology is presented as four distinct design generations: (1) prototypes, (2) current operating plants, (3) advanced light water reactor technology, and (4) revolutionary design concepts (i.e., Generation IV) that are now under development. The U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) program is focused on the research and development of Generation IV designs that are safe, economic, proliferation-resistant, and will address current waste issues. NERI provides grants for independently peer-reviewed proposals from universities, national laboratories and industry for advanced nuclear research and development. Several NERI projects awarded in 1999 are described in terms of how they remove barriers to nuclear power plant expansion. Another DOE effort, the Accelerator Transmutation of Waste program, will seek to reduce and ameliorate civilian reactor waste. The Accelerator Transmutation of Waste program will involve a six-year science-based research plan to define key technical issues. Finally, the need for international collaboration is stressed for fourth-generation nuclear power technology development.},

  abstract = {Air ingress with graphite burning belongs to the accident scenarios in HTRs with potentially severe consequences. This paper gives an overview of basic phenomena of graphite burning like ignition conditions and moving reaction fronts. The pioneering graphite burning experiments of Don Schweitzer are successfully reevaluated. Ignition conditions are examined, and it is underlined that burning depends not only on graphite properties but also on the heat balance in the whole graphite arrangement. In graphite-moderated reactors, ignition occurs at about 650{$^\circ$}C for small air flow rates: this means that normal operation temperatures in HTRs always allow for ignition. Fuel behaviour in air ingress, as determined in the KORA facility, is discussed: up to about 1300{$^\circ$}C modern TRISO fuel is stable in air, but from 1500{$^\circ$}C a complete, fast destruction is observed. Exemplary calculations on massive air ingress by chimney draught performed with REACT/THERMIX are outlined. For a hot bottom reflector there is a substantial time span before fuel is attacked. Because severe air ingress in well-designed HTRs belongs to beyond design basis accidents, the knowledge is fairly good. Concerning protecting measures, a more detailed examination of thick SiC layers is proposed.},

Earlier Fort St. Vrain operating experience through the time of successful full-power testing in November 1981 has been summarized by the licensee and the reactor vendor, GA Technologies, Inc. (GA), in papers presented at several different forums during 1982. In addition, extensive and very useful detailed evaluations of preoperational and startup testing and of the rise-to-power operating experience through completion of the first refueling outage in August 1979 have been compiled into a series of reports under the sponsorship of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Finally, the US Department of Energy's Fort St. Vrain Improvement Plan provides a summary of the major operational limits which have affected the plant since start-up. The events discussed here are categorized based on the major systems affected, namely, (1) primary system and reactor vessel, (2) electrical systems, and (3) the reactor building. In all cases to be discussed, the lessons to be learned are vigilance and prevention. These lessons translate into the need for the recognition and control of unexpected situations and of their potential for branching effects. At Fort St. Vrain, these lessons are found in the effects of moisture ingress, in the challenges experienced to the supply of essential electrical power, and in controlling the environment of the reactor building. 13 refs.},

It became active in work for the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power, Defense Nuclear Agency, Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Program, the Gas-Cooled and High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor programs, and the Japanese-American Shielding Program of Experimental Research, just to mention a few of the more extensive ones. The history of the TSF as presented in this report describes the various experiments that were performed using the different reactors. The experiments are categorized as to the programs which they supported and placed in corresponding chapters.

  abstract = {The Pebble-Bed Reactor Experiment (PBRE) was designed to advance the pebble-bed concept by providing a test of characteristic features and make contriliutions to the general development of all-ceramic gas-cooled reactors. The following objectives were established for the reactor experiment: to investigate key features of the pebble-bed concept, including on-stream fuel handling, movement of fuel through bed, and performance of core; to obtain operation and maintenance experience with a system contaminated with fission- product activity; and to investigate the behavior of graphite fuel elements. A fourth objective, study of the behavior of core materials at conditions occurring with exit gas temperatures in the range 2000 to 2500 deg F, was tentatively included. The preliminary design oE a 5-Mw(t) reactor for achieving these objectives was prepared. The core of the PBRE is a 2 1/2-ft-diam, 4-ft-tall cylinder containing approximately 12,000 spherical graphite fuel elements 1 1/2 in. in diameter. Fuel spheres are added to and removed from the core by gravity flow, and these operations are performed while the reactor is at power by using pairs of valves for passage of elements into and out of the high-pressure system. Exposed fuel can be recycled to the top of the core. Helium coolant at 500 psia enters the bottom of the core at 550 deg F and emerges from the top at 1250 deg F. Concentric ducting connects the reactor to a single heat exchanger, which is located sufficiently high above the core that natural circulation will suffice to remove afterheat in the event the blower ceases to function. The coolant flow path is such that the entire pressure envelope is swept with helium at the temperature at which it emerges from the heat exchanger. Provision for semi- remote maintenance of contaminated components is emphasized in the layout, and most of the equipment in the primary and auxiliary systems is accessible from above by the removal of modular shielding units. Thc design permits replacement of the entire core graphite structure, The reactor can be adapted for testing core materials at high temperature by attemperation of the hot helium emerging from the core wwiih cool gas in a plenum in the upper graphite structure. Location of the PBRE at the site of the HRE-2 facility is proposed to take advantage of available buildings and services, but the reactor and auxiliary equipment will be contained in a completely new vessel located adjacent to the existing building. The design and direct construction cost of the reactor plant is estimated to be 958,000, allowance for contingencies, overhead, and escalation brings the total to ,260,000. High-temperature operation can be achieved when desired for an additional expenditure of less than 0,000. (auth)},

  abstract = {Last decades in Russia the investigations of heavy coolant are conducted for fast stationary reactors (SVBR, BREST, etc) and acceleration driven systems. Except lead-bismuth alloy it is suggested to use pure lead as the coolant (BREST-OD-300). Lead is attractive due to its profitability and low prices; its polonium activity is approximately 1000 times as less than that in lead-bismuth alloy. However, high melting temperature (327 deg.C) causes some difficulties when Pb-Bi is used as a coolant. The conformity of basic physical-chemical processes in loops with lead and lead-bismuth coolants was experimentally approved. It allows using for investigation of lead the working out for lead-bismuth coolant. As a result, the following issues have been developed for substantiation of heavy-metal nuclear power engineering facilities: scientific bases of treatment of coolant, new constructional materials, methods and devices for monitoring coolant quality, methods and devices for impurity removal from the coolant and loop surfaces. As for new generation NPFs, that factors appeared, which define new technological problems of heavy metal coolants. They are scale, resource, configuration, regime parametres. Results of complex researches of lead coolant technology allowed working out the project \&lt;Regulations on technology of the reference with the lead coolant in Reactor Facility BREST-OD-300\&gt;. In this project the main actions for lead coolant technology at all stages of building, putting into operation and campaign of BREST-OD-300 are stated.},

  abstract = {The lineage of the Dragon Project can be traced back to 1955 when the United Kingdom launched a nuclear power programme which involved the construction of large graphite moderated reactors fuelled with natural uranium and cooled by carbon dioxide. Not long afterwards the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) of the then newly formed Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), in the spirit of the time, sought to encourage the construction of nuclear power stations and the development of joint nuclear undertakings. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) had, since 1949, been studying possible long term improvements in energy conversion efficiency resulting from higher coolant gas temperatures and the use of ceramic materials. A 1955 paper on gas-cooled reactors using the U-233/thorium cycle attracted interest and this progressed to the definition of an initial programme. The high temperature work led to a proposal for a 20MW(Th) Reactor Experiment and one important consequence of the ENEA/OEEC initiative was the setting up in April 1959 of the international Dragon Project Agreement. Initial experiments at Harwell in 1957 had involved the coating of small spheroidal particles of uranium carbide or oxide with pyrolytic carbon which were then bonded with carbonaceous material. But experiments demonstrated that fission products such as caesium, strontium or barium could diffuse through such coatings. This led in 1961 to the modification of the coated particle design by the addition of an intermediate layer of silicon or zirconium carbide. The small size of the particles necessitated a statistical approach to quality during manufacture and effort was concentrated on the minimisation of the broken or defective particle fraction. The subsequent operation of the Dragon Reactor for over 10 years confirmed the benign nature of a HTR. It also proved that fuel bodies made with coated particles were capable of maintaining a high degree of fission product containment at high temperatures and for high burn-ups. What is remarkable is the speed with which the particle design evolved. The success of the choices that were made resulted in the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries. Irrespective of the particular core design, the basic component of HTR fuel is the coated particle. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised worldwide that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors. They enable more efficient use of fissile isotopes as well as providing inherent reactor safety. Unlike most other reactor designs, the HTR can take economic advantage from operation at high gas outlet temperatures, whilst maintaining the good retention of fuel and fission products within the fuel elements. The fuel cycle can use uranium, thorium or plutonium. In addition the burn-up can be high, permitting safe disposal of spent fuel without the need for reprocessing. Fast reactors based on coated particle fuel may be a future possibility. The Dragon Project was a successful political collaboration and a technical triumph in demonstrating a new type of reactor. However, overstretched resources coupled with a world-wide trend in that era to favour water reactors caused work on Dragon to be terminated in March 1976. By then the main objectives for the Dragon Project had been successfully achieved and extensively reported. The progression from the 20MWE(Th) Dragon to a 1200MW(e) power station as a single jump in technology was too large a step for the time. The experiences of the other major civil HTR projects of the same period in Germany and the United States of America resulted in the high temperature reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries as is evidenced by the large number of papers presented at the biennial HTR conferences. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors.},

The purpose of this irradiation was to determine the dimensional stability of the alloy under conditions approaching those contemplated for D/sub 2/O-cooled power reactors. Successive dimensional measurements revealed a sharp change in swelling rate between 700 and 1280 Mwd/t burnup. The amount of swelling increased during this interval from 0.8 to 3.6\% (0.7\% final cladding strain).

For modeling purposes, aerosol dispersion of approximately 7g of 90Sr equaling 3.7{\texttimes}1013Bq (1000Ci) with effective release heights of 50 and 100m above street level is estimated under varying local-scale atmospheric conditions. Maximum inhalation doses at the level of ⩾1, ⩾5, ⩾10, ⩾50mSv are used as evaluative criteria to assess probable consequences. The intentional release of a relatively small amount of 90Sr using a conventional explosive has the potential to cause internal exposure to beta-radiation with relatively high maximum inhalation doses achieving hundreds of mSv, but the spatial extent of the area within which high exposures might occur is very small with most of the population receiving maximum inhalation doses between 1 and 10mSv. The extent of radiation contamination (area and activity) is dependent on 90Sr particle size, the height of release, and local weather conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of protracted low dose, low dose rate exposure to ionising radiation on the risk of cancer. Design Multinational cohort study. Setting Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in France, the UK, and the US included in a major update to the International Nuclear Workers Study (INWORKS). Participants 309 932 workers with individual monitoring data for external exposure to ionising radiation and a total follow-up of 10.7 million person years. Main outcome measures Estimates of excess relative rate per gray (Gy) of radiation dose for mortality from cancer. Results The study included 103 553 deaths, of which 28 089 were due to solid cancers. The estimated rate of mortality due to solid cancer increased with cumulative dose by 52\% (90\% confidence interval 27\% to 77\%) per Gy, lagged by 10 years. Restricting the analysis to the low cumulative dose range (0-100 mGy) approximately doubled the estimate of association (and increased the width of its confidence interval), as did restricting the analysis to workers hired in the more recent years of operations when estimates of occupational external penetrating radiation dose were recorded more accurately. Exclusion of deaths from lung cancer and pleural cancer had a modest effect on the estimated magnitude of association, providing indirect evidence that the association was not substantially confounded by smoking or occupational exposure to asbestos. Conclusions This major update to INWORKS provides a direct estimate of the association between protracted low dose exposure to ionising radiation and solid cancer mortality based on some of the world's most informative cohorts of radiation workers. The summary estimate of excess relative rate solid cancer mortality per Gy is larger than estimates currently informing radiation protection, and some evidence suggests a steeper slope for the dose-response association in the low dose range than over the full dose range. These results can help to strengthen radiation protection, especially for low dose exposures that are of primary interest in contemporary medical, occupational, and environmental settings.},

  abstract = {Capital cost and construction schedule estimates for nuclear projects often under-estimate the realized costs upon project completion. Uncertainty quantification of nuclear construction project cost estimates have seldom been used in open-literature and have not shown to effectively bound the realized schedules and costs. Building on recent studies of advanced light water reactor costs and construction schedules, this paper explored the risk of different construction delay drivers and the implication on total installed cost. Using data from previous nuclear projects, as well as other megaprojects and analyses, we modeled the impact of supply chain delays, human error, change orders, and productivity on four different reactor architectures: a large passively safe PWR, a large modular BWR, small modular BWR, and a multi-module PWR. The probability and impact of supply chain delays and change orders were modeled based on the AP1000 construction experience at Vogtle Units 3 \& 4, while the human error and productivity models came from non-nuclear sources. The estimated risk to cost overrun and schedule delays were found to be significant. The multi-module plant was the most susceptible to construction delays, and the small modular BWR was the least susceptible. However, the risk mitigation by a small reactor only offset the lost economy of scale in a few scenarios relative to the large reactors, because there was still significant onsite work despite modularization. Access to large labor markets mitigated the upper bound cost and schedule risks significantly for all reactor types. Finally, design changes and the resulting productivity hits were the largest driver of construction delays, and human error was the second largest driver, but supply chain delays only accounted for a small fraction of the delays for the assessed water-cooled concepts.},

The original droplet burn model, which was based on the NACOM code, was improved in several aspects, especially concerning evaluation of the droplet burning rate, reaction chemistry and heat balance, spray geometry and droplet motion, and consistency with CONTAIN standards of gas property evaluation. An additional droplet burning model based on a proposal by Krolikowski was made available to include the effect of the chemical equilibrium conditions at the flame temperature. The models were validated against single-droplet burn experiments as well as spray and jet fire experiments. Reasonable agreement was found between the two burn models and experimental data. When the gas temperature in the burning compartment reaches high values, the Krolikowski model seems to be preferable. Critical parameters for spray fire evaluation were found to be the spray characterization, especially the droplet size, which largely determines the burning efficiency, and heat transfer conditions at the interface between the atmosphere and structures, which controls the thermal hydraulic behavior in the burn compartment.},

Triad National Security LLC cultural resources staff have completed the evaluation of two buildings, called the UHTREX Complex, for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (Register). This complex includes the UHTREX Reactor Building (TA-52-1), and an associated Mechanical Assembly Building (TA-52-11). As part of LANL's Footprint Reduction Program, both facilities of the UHTREX Complex are scheduled for characterization and demolition. In addition to evaluating their eligibility in the Register, the properties at TA-52 were assessed for potential adaptive reuse, long-term preservation, and public interpretation. Based on the findings in this assessment report, both TA-52-1 and TA-52-11 have been determined to not be eligible for inclusion in the Register. The history of the UHTREX Complex lacks association with exceptionally significant Cold War events of scientific developments. Both TA-52-1 and TA-52-11 lack the necessary internal historic integrity suitable for long-term preservation or public interpretation. And both facilities contain legacy radioactive contamination, which prohibits their reuse. In addition to its loss of integrity and context, TA-52- 11 has been determined ineligible due to its status as a support building of secondary or minor importance. In compliance with Section 106 and Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and with the Programmatic Agreement among the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, Los Alamos Field Office, the New Mexico State Historic Preservation Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Concerning Management of the Historic Properties at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, the SHPO is requested to concur with the eligibility determinations contained in this report for the UHTREX Complex in TA-52.},

  abstract = {Numerous advanced reactor concepts have been proposed to replace light water reactors ever since their establishment as the dominant technology for nuclear energy production. While most designs seek to improve cost competitiveness and safety, the implausibility of doing so with affordable materials or existing nuclear fuel infrastructure reduces the possibility of near-term deployment, especially in developing countries. The organic nuclear concept, first explored in the 1950s, offers an attractive alternative to advanced reactor designs being considered. The advent of high temperature fluids, along with advances in hydrocracking and reforming technologies driven by the oil and gas industries, make the organic concept even more viable today. We present a simple, cost-effective, and safe small modular nuclear reactor for offshore underwater deployment. The core is moderated by graphite, zirconium hydride, and organic fluid while cooled by the organic fluid. The organic coolant enables operation near atmospheric pressure and use of plain carbon steel for the reactor tank and primary coolant piping system. The core is designed to mitigate the coolant degradation seen in early organic reactors. Overall, the design provides a power density of 40~kW/L, while reducing the reactor hull size by 40\% compared with a pressurized water reactor while significantly reducing capital plant costs.},

Hence the purpose of the paper was directed towards identifying and classifying a generic set of design activities from published literature into what are referred to as design definition activities, design evaluation activities and design management activities. In an attempt to achieve a shared understanding of these activities, a set of consistent and coherent definitions of these activities are deliberated and presented. A knowledge level representation based on Newells Knowledge Level hypothesis governed by the Principle of Rationality is used to represent a design activity that is motivated by a design goal of that activity through which input knowledge is changed into output knowledge by the design agents knowledge. The ontological completeness, clarity and coherence of activities are evaluated through a protocol analysis and the design process in the domain of electronic design (in particular System-on-a-Chip designs (SoC)).},

To understand on how HELIOS and DRAGON perform, a simple hexagonal fuel pin cell based on the MHTGR design was analyzed. In total, there are three benchmark cases, with each case increasing in complexity. These cases were selected to help distinguish and identify limitations and benefits of each reactor physics code.},

Zhores Medvedev, a Soviet dissident, has written numerous journal articles as well as two books on the subject. He has argued that a vast contaminated area exists east of the city of Kyshtym in the southern Ural Mountains. Further, he has alleged that a nuclear waste disposal accident in 1957 to 1958 caused the contamination. The authors of this report are in partial disagreement with Medvedev's first allegation and in complete disagreement with his second. A contaminated area does exist east of Kyshtym, but Soviet carelessness coupled with general disregard for the citizenry and the environment are the prime causative factors, not a nuclear waste accident.},

It was December 2, 1942. The group, led by Italian physicist and Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi, stacked graphite bricks, piling 57 layers that totaled more than 770,000 pounds. Later named Chicago Pile-1, their goal was to create the world's first self-sustaining, controlled nuclear chain reaction. Inside the approximately 20-feet-tall pile were smaller blocks of uranium and control rods that, when removed, would cause the reaction to go critical -- meaning create a nuclear chain reaction. It was roughly \$1 million worth of materials, equivalent to nearly \$16 million today, and a concept that a nuclear chain reaction would allow the weaponization of the atom. ``Its success would be the crucial proof needed to know it would be possible to create an atomic bomb,'' said LANL Historian Roger Meade (C-NR). ``This was the precursor to the Lab we have today, nearly 80 years later.''},

  abstract = {HTGR design methods verifications have been performed under the Peach Bottom End-of-Life Program by comparison of actual with predicted physics, thermal, fission product, and materials behavior in Peach Bottom. These design methods verifications have utilized the data determined from nondestructive fuel and circuit gamma scanning on-site, from laboratory examinations of samples removed from the primary circuit, and from a complementary program of Peach Bottom fuel element postirradiation examinations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Fifty-five driver fuel elements were axially gamma scanned to determine fission product distributions for use in burnup calculations, power profile determinations, and fission product release and redistribution studies. The cesium plateout distribution in the primary circuit was subsequently mapped by gamma scanning the ducting at 12 locations, axially traversing 79 steam generator tubes with Cd Te detectors from the water side, and internally scanning two vertical runs of ducting. Component removal involved trepanning of the primary circuit ducting, obtaining access to the steam generator internals, and removing over 100 superheater, evaporator, and economizer tubing samples. During this phase, macroscopic examinations of the steam generator and ducting internals were performed. Subsequent laboratory examinations of removed samples included radiochemical tests to substantiate in-situ gamma scans and to determine /sup 90/Sr distributions; metallurgical tests to evaluate surface films, microstructural changes, and residual mechanical properties; and tritium permeation tests to provide data for improving HTGR tritium release predictions. The condition and metallurgical integrity of all components examined were found to be excellent, with minimal coolant/substrate interaction and entirely acceptable residual mechanical properties. The suitability of the materials used in the construction of the Peach Bottom HTGR was thereby confirmed.},

  abstract = {The continued development of High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors (HTGRs) requires verification of HTGR design and safety features with reliable high fidelity physics models and robust, efficient, and accurate codes. The predictive capability of coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics and depletion simulations for reactor design and safety analysis can be assessed with sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty analysis (UA) methods. Uncertainty originates from errors in physical data, manufacturing uncertainties, modelling and computational algorithms. (The interested reader is referred to the large body of published SA and UA literature for a more complete overview of the various types of uncertainties, methodologies and results obtained). SA is helpful for ranking the various sources of uncertainty and error in the results of core analyses. SA and UA are required to address cost, safety, and licensing needs and should be applied to all aspects of reactor multi-physics simulation. SA and UA can guide experimental, modelling, and algorithm research and development. Current SA and UA rely either on derivative-based methods such as stochastic sampling methods or on generalized perturbation theory to obtain sensitivity coefficients. Neither approach addresses all needs. In order to benefit from recent advances in modelling and simulation and the availability of new covariance data (nuclear data uncertainties) extensive sensitivity and uncertainty studies are needed for quantification of the impact of different sources of uncertainties on the design and safety parameters of HTGRs. Only a parallel effort in advanced simulation and in nuclear data improvement will be able to provide designers with more robust and well validated calculation tools to meet design target accuracies. In February 2009, the Technical Working Group on Gas-Cooled Reactors (TWG-GCR) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommended that the proposed Coordinated Research Program (CRP) on the HTGR Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (UAM) be implemented. This CRP is a continuation of the previous IAEA and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) international activities on Verification and Validation (V\&amp;V) of available analytical capabilities for HTGR simulation for design and safety evaluations. Within the framework of these activities different numerical and experimental benchmark problems were performed and insight was gained about specific physics phenomena and the adequacy of analysis methods.},

  abstract = {Radio - active elements are generated by a neutron radiation which is emitted from a space in which a nuclear transmutation process is maintained and falls upon an element, thereby transmuting it into a radioactive element.  The neutron radiation may be produced by the action of a beam of diplogen ions produced by a canal-ray tube 9, Fig. 2, and accelerated in a continuation 10 of the tube, which enter a chamber containing diplogen, a diplogen compound of lithium or other light elements.  The element to be transmuted into the radio-active element is contained in a body surrounding this chamber. Elements having half-life periods exceeding 24 hours may be thus generated.  The radiation may also be produced by heating up a small space 44, Fig. 4, containing diplogen, lithium hydride or other light element compound of hydrogen or diplogen by bombarding it with canal rays, for example:--a diplon beam, or with a proton or electron beam generated by the discharge of condensers 52 through the cathode ray tubes 41, and passing through metal windows to the container 44.  In another form, a cathode-ray tube having a thin metal window 27 serving as the anode is excited from a 10 million volt impulse generator and the beam falls on a target 31 of lead mounted on a rotating anti-cathode 30 and water cooled through the axle 35.  The X-rays generated produce neutrons in a beryllium block 52 which is surrounded by a block 34 of the element, for example iodine or arsenic, which is to be transmuted to the radio-active element.  In the case, for example, of iodine the radioactive element produced is an isotope, and the element is then irradiated in the form of a compound, for example a carbon compound such as iodoform or ethyl iodide, which leaves the radio-active isotope free.  A small amount of ordinary iodine may be added before or after radiation and the whole then separated so that the radio-active iodine is obtained together with the added iodine.},

These reactors are quite different in design, implementation and operation from conventional light-water-cooled and -moderated reactors (LWRs) currently in widespread use, which were scaled-up from submarine nuclear propulsion reactors. They feature an inexpensive initial fuel loading which lasts the entire 30-year design life of the power-plant. The reactor contains a core comprised of a nuclear ignitor and a nuclear burn-wave propagating region comprised of natural thorium or uranium, a pressure shell for coolant transport purposes, and automatic emergency heat-dumping means to obviate concerns regarding loss-of-coolant accidents during the plant`s operational and post-operational life. These reactors are proposed to be situated in suitable environments at \{approximately\}100 meter depths underground, and their operation is completely automatic, with no moving parts and no human access during or after its operational lifetime, in order to avoid both error and misuse. The power plant`s heat engine and electrical generator subsystems are located above-ground.},

Born in Hungary in 1908, Teller witnessed the rise of Nazism and anti-Semitism, two world wars, the McCarthy era, and the changing face of big science. A brilliant and controversial figure, Teller brings to these events a perspective that is at once surprising and insightful. Edward Teller is perhaps best known for his belief in freedom through strong defense. But this extraordinary memoir at last reveals the man behind the headlines -- passionate and humorous, devoted and loyal. Never before has Teller told his story as fully as he does here. We learn Teller's true position on everything from the bombing of Japan to the pursuit of weapons research in the post-war years. In clear and compelling prose, Teller chronicles the people and events that shaped him as a scientist, beginning with his early love of music and math, and continuing with his study of quantum physics under Werner Heisenberg. Present at many of the pivotal moments in modern science, Teller also describes his relationships with some of the century's greatest minds -- Einstein, Bohr, Fermi, Szilard, von Neumann -- and offers an honest assessment of the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs, the founding of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and his complicated relationship with J. Robert Oppenheimer. He also offers, for the first time, a moving portrait of his childhood, his marriage and family life, and his deep friendship with physicist Maria Mayer. Writing about those aspects of his life that have had important public consequences -- from his conservative politics to his relationships with scientists and presidents -- Teller reveals himself to be a man with deep beliefs about liberty, security, and the moral responsibility of science. - Jacket flap},

Among the codes with capabilities in this respect are MAEROS (Sandia) AEROMECH (University of Missouri) and NAUA-Mod4 (Karlsruhe). NAUA was specifically developed to model steam-aerosol behavior in hypothetical accidents in pressurized water reactors. It is based upon a series of experiments, in which aerosols of uranium oxide, platinum oxide, and sodium nitrate were generated in a steam atmosphere. Several series of experiments have been conducted in the NSPP vessel using aerosols generated by plasma torch in a steam-air atmosphere. From these experiments we have selected those performed with iron oxide or uranium oxide for comparison with various computer codes, principally NAUA-Mod4. Comparisons of particle size are displayed also. Results of parameter studies to determine the sensitivity of the calculated results to the steam input level, initial particle size, deposition parameters, and assumed particle density are presented.},

The utility signed contracts for Big Rock Point with Bechtel Corporation as the prime contractor and General Electric as equipment supplier. The AEC awarded the plant its operating license and it achieved its first sustained chain reaction on September 27, 1962. The plant, the first BWR direct-cycle, forced circulation, high power density nuclear facility in the world was used for a number of full-scale tests of various fuel designs over its life-time. The plant reached the 10-million megawatt production level in March 1991 and was named a Nuclear Historic Landmark by the American Nuclear Society.},

Several publications describe cleaning techniques and operating experience at different sodium cleaning facilities. NE Standard F5-9, "Sodium Removal Processes," is the official Department of Energy document that establishes standard procedures for sodium removal with respect to three techniques: water vapor- nitrogen (WVN), alcohol, and evaporation. The Standard does not make a comparison of the three processes to note their advantages and disadvantages, cleaning efficiencies, and which process is best for a particular sodium cleaning operation. This handbook will describe the three cleaning techniques mentioned above, do a comparison of their cleaning effectiveness and application, and discuss ways of processing the sodium metal and sodium compounds produced from component cleaning operations. Sodium removal facilities have already been established at various Liquid Metal Reactor (LMR) installations in the United States and abroad. The available information on sodium cleaning experience at these facilities will be used to develop the sodium removal section of the handbook. The sodium disposal section will cover the various methods available for processing the sodium material (i.e., sodium metal and sodium compounds) produced when LMR components are cleaned. These processes will convert the sodium material to a product that is either suitable for disposal or to be used in neutralizing acidic waste. The primary objective of this handbook is to compile and present information that will assist future operators of LMRs in the selection of a sodium removal facility to suit their particular need and to process the sodium material produced from the component cleaning operations.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the Department of Energy Water Cooled Breeder Program was to demonstrate pratical breeding in a uranium-233/thorium fueled core while producing electrical energy in a commercial water reactor generating station. A demonstration Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) was successfully operated for more than 29,000 effective full power hours in the Shippingport Atomic Power Station. The reactor operated with an availability factor of 76\% and had a gross electrical output of 2,128,943,470 kilowatt hours. Following operation, the expended core was examined and no evidence of any fuel element defects was found. Nondestructive assay of 524 fuel rods determined that 1.39 percent more fissile fuel was present at the end of core life than at the beginning, proving that breeding had occurred. This demonstrates the existence of a vast source of electrical energy using plentiful domestic thorium potentially capable of supplying the entire national need for many centuries. To build on the successful design and operation of the Shippingport Breeder Core and to provide the technology to implement this concept, several reactor designs of large breeders and prebreeders were developed for commercial-sized plants of 900--1000 Mw(e) net. This report summarizes the Water Cooled Breeder Program from its inception in 1965 to its completion in 1987. Four hundred thirty-six technical reports are referenced which document the work conducted as part of this program. This work demonstrated that the Light Water Breeder Reactor is a viable alternative as a PWR replacement in the next generation of nuclear reactors. This transition would only require a minimum of change in design and fabrication of the reactor and operation of the plant.},

  abstract = {The First Nuclear Era is Alvin Weinberg's autobiography, the memoirs of a most influential American nuclear engineer/physicist. These reminiscences date from the dawning of the nuclear age in the early 1940s to the present. It is the story of one notable scientist's life and times and a look back at one of humankind's most ambitious endeavors: the attempt to harness and safely distribute nuclear power. Weinberg has witnessed and played a major part in many of the defining scientific moments of his era. Here he describes his academic career at the University of Chicago, under the tutelage of Nicolas Rashevsky and Carl Eckart. He recalls his wartime days at the Manhattan Project's Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory where he helped Nobelist Eugene Wigner design the Hanford plutonium producing reactors. He then focuses on what would become the abiding legacy of his professional life: his development of and involvement with nuclear reactors. In discussing both great commercial successes (such as the Light-Water Reactor) and unsuccessful experiments, Weinberg offers an objective critique of the technical and political shortcomings that have haunted the nuclear age. He also demonstrates how the lessons learned from unsuccessful reactors paved the way for later triumphs},

While media coverage during the Three Mile Island incident made the public aware of some reactor hardware and radiation hazards, Weinberg suggests that an acceptable nuclear future should have six characteristics: increased physical isolation of reactors, further technical improvements, separation of generation and distribution, professionalization of the nuclear cadre, heightened security, and public education about the hazards of radiation. Weinberg feels the question of low-level radiation effects to be critical to public acceptance of nuclear energy. Since the effects (if any) are so rarely seen because exposures are so small, the issue may be beyond the ability of science to decipher. Weinberg again explains his reference to nuclear energy as a Faustian Bargain: ''...nuclear energy, that miraculous and quite unsuspected source of energy, demands an unprecedented degree of expertise, attention to detail, and social stability. In return, man has, in the breeder reactor, an inexhaustible energy source.''},

The design for the reactor leaped from an extremely slender volume of research, most of which was barely a year old. In spite of the unproven technology and wartime constraints, the reactor was constructed and taken to criticality with complete success, all within a single year. In the first nine months of operation, it produced fissionable material (plutonium) for the world's first atomic bomb, the Trinity test in July 1945, and for the atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, which hastened the end of World War II.

  abstract = {The great horse manure crisis of 1894 refers to the idea that the greatest obstacle to urban development at the turn of the century was the difficulty of removing horse manure from the streets.  More broadly, it is an analogy for supposedly insuperable extrapolated problems being rendered moot by the introduction of new technologies. The phrase originates from a 2004 article by Stephen Davies entitled "The Great Horse-Manure Crisis of 1894". The supposed problem of excessive horse-manure collecting in the streets was solved by the proliferation of cars, buses and electrified trams which replaced horses as the means of transportation in big cities. The term great horse manure crisis of 1894 is often used to denote a problem which seems to be impossible to solve because it is being looked at from the wrong direction.  The name refers to a supposed 1894 publication in The Times, which said "In 50 years, every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure". The reasoning was that more horses are needed to remove the manure, and these horses produce more manure. An urban planning conference in 1898 supposedly broke up before its scheduled end due to a failure to find an answer to this problem.  No such statement in the Times, nor conference result, is known, but in 1893 London there was a complaint that horse manure, formerly an economic good that could be sold, had become a disposal problem, an economic bad. The supposed crisis has since taken on life as a useful analogy.},

Samples were exposed to Na in individual crucibles with a fixed amount of oxygen. In the second regime, approx.600 less than or equal to T less than or equal to 2000/sup 0/C, tubes fabricated from the refractory alloys were loaded with UO/sub 2/ and Na containing 400 ppmw (0). The bottom of the tube was heated to 2000/sup 0/C and the top was allowed to cool naturally. A reflux condition was created in the tube and gradients approaching 250/sup 0/C/cm were obtained on the walls of the tube. All of the materials were found to be compatible with Na in the low temperature regime and Ta-10W, Ta-8W-2Hf, and Mo-41Re were found to be compatible in the high temperature regime. Re and Re-5W exhibited grain boundary failure when subjected to the high temperature test conditions. Re additions were found to enhance the tensile properties of Mo but did not significantly improve the fracture toughness as inferred from the fractography. The mechanical properties of the Ta alloys were found to be very sensitive to the impurities in the Na. Fracture initiation was found to control the tensile ductility and fracture energy (defined as the area under the load-displacement curve of the tensile test divided by the original area at the root of the notches) of the Mo, Mo-Re, and Re alloys.},
