On December 12, 1952, the NRX reactor in Ontario, Canada suffered an accidental
runaway. The increased power caused the fuel to heat up such that some of it
melted, thereby becoming the first ever nuclear meltdown in history. Highly
radioactive material spilled into the basement, and around 1 million gallons of
water containing 10,000 Ci of fission products had to be disposed of. The
NRX was restored and turned back on with improved safety systems and uprated power.
It operated until 1993.

I recently found this film summarizing the accident and cleanups. I got it
scanned, and have posted it online here.

(If you've heard of the reactor accident that Jimmy Carter helped with while he
was in the Navy, this is it. Does anyone see young Jimmy Carter in the footage?)
