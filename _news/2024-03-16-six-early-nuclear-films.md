I couldn't be happier to be announcing the addition of _six_(!) more digitized
historical nuclear films to the world's collection, thanks to the generosity of
[Last Energy](https://www.lastenergy.com/). This is our biggest batch of
digitizations yet! As before, these were all sourced from 16mm films in
the US National Archives. We will continue shedding light on valuable and
historic films. If you're interested in participating, see contact info at
bottom of page.

## Army Package Power Reactor (1957)

The Army needed reactors that could be packaged up and air-lifted to remote
bases to provide power. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory designed a compact and
simple pressurized water reactor that could achieve this. A prototype was
suggested, and so the SM-1 was built and operated in Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. This
film explains the package power program and shows construction and initial
operation of the SM-1, aka the APPR-1.

This is film [88093]({%link old-videos.md%}#army-package-power-reactor) in our catalog.

## Atomic Power and the United States (1957)

This one summarizes the growing need for non-fossil electricity sources and
explains how the USA is approaching the development of economical nuclear power
by building a variety of promising concepts, including the Fast Breeder Reactor
(EBR-1 in Idaho) Sodium Graphite Reactor (SRE in CA), the Pressurized Water
Reactor (APPR-1/SM-1 and Shippingport), the Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor (HRE at
Oak Ridge), and the Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR at Argonne).

## Nuclear Energy Goes Rural (1963)

The second round of the US Power Demonstration Reactor Program aimed to bring
more newcomers into the nuclear industry, both as customers and as constructors.
Several small rural communities were awardees in the program, and the Elk River
Reactor in Elk River, MN was built. This film describes the reactor.

## Operating Experience, Indian Point (1964)

The third international "Atoms for Peace" conference occurred in Geneva in 1964.
The US delegation produced 24 films summarizing progress in nuclear in the USA.
The following was one of them. As the film explains, concerns about long-term
uranium supply were serious in 1955, so the Indian Point 1 reactor used thorium
as the fertile material instead of U-238. This was the first commercial-scale
use of a thorium fuel cycle.

(Not mentioned in the film is the fact that the second core moved away from
thorium to reduce cost, and because much more uranium had been discovered than
initially expected)

## Operating Experience, Yankee Rowe (1964)

This was another 1964 film of the same vintage, but about the Yankee Rowe PWR.
Yankee Rowe was developed by a consortium of utility companies. It's excellent
performance in construction and operation was a major factor in the achievement
of economical nuclear power that led to a LWR-dominant fleet.

## Naval research laboratory reactor (1958)

Due to an issue with the audio track, this film was processed a bit later than
the others, and [has been announced and displayed
here]({% link _news/2024-04-07-naval-research-laboratory-reactor-1985.md %}).
