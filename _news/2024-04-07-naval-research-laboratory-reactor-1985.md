  A film from the 1958 'Atoms for Peace' conference in Geneva
  has been digitized and can be seen here. It describes the
  Naval Research Laboratory Reactor, a swimming-pool type
  research reactor fueled with HEU.

As a follow-up to [our previous digitization announcement]({% link
_news/2024-03-16-six-early-nuclear-films.md %}), I'm now pleased to post the
following.

## Naval research laboratory reactor (1958)

This film describes and shows the swimming pool type reactor used for basic
research. It talks about the planning, shows some scenes from construction,
describes the reactor, explains the various experimental facilities, and shows
the hot cell and manipulators.

This reactor used plate-type fuel enriched 90% in U-235 with 20 mil aluminum
cladding. The reactor was suspended from a movable bridge and could be operated
out in the pool, or placed in a niche surrounded by graphite and beam ports. In
the pool, the critical mass was 3400 grams of U-235, but when the reactor was
positioned in the niche, the graphite reflected neutrons enough to reduce the
critical mass down to 2700 grams. The reactor was initially authorized to
operate at 100 kW, which could be cooled by natural convection of the water.

This film was originally shown at the 2nd International Conference on the
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, 1958 (2nd "Atoms for Peace"
conference) as part of the US technical exhibit.
The graphite thermal column was surrounded by 7 ft. thick concrete shielding.

Thanks again to **Last Energy** for sponsoring the digitization of this film!!
