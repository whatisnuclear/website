  This reactor was manufactured in a factory, flown by C-130 to an airfield, and

We're **extremely** excited to announce the first of _four_ historical nuclear
films in our latest batch of 4K digitizations from 16mm film at the National
Archives. It features the 1 MWe **PM-1 military microreactor**, a small modular
reactor that the US Army manufactured and tested in a factory, disassembled into
16 modules, and air-lifted to the closest airfield by C-130, trucked to site,
re-assembled, and then powered a remote Cold War radar station back in 1962. It
had direct air cooling, meaning it did not need to be near any water supply. It
was designed to be disassembled, moved, and re-assembled as necessary. No field
welding was needed for re-assembly. It was a PWR that could be operated by a
crew of 2.

As for what happened in the end, the [PM-1 Final Summary Report](/assets/PM-1%20
Final%20Summary%20Report.pdf) explains the situation clearly. This report contains
the lessons learned after operating the military microreactor for 4 years.
It highlights all the unplanned outages, maintenance costs, and lists the
performance of each individual system. It's highly readable, but to summarize
briefly:

- The reactor was difficult to perform maintenance on because of its compactness.
  The operators recommend designing the next microreactor with maintenance
  requirements satisfied first, and then compactness requirements
- The conventional steam plant cause roughly half of the unplanned outages
  and required a lot of maintenance, leading the authors to suggest that
  perhaps a non-steam approach is needed at this small scale (e.g. other
  energy conversion systems).
- The nuclear instrumentation system was oversensitive and overcomplicated
  for a field plant.
- The HVAC system and building design were wholly inadequate
- It was difficult to maintain qualified staff to operate and maintain the reactor
- The reactor was used as a training reactor for crews headed to Antarctica to
  operate the sister plant PM-3A, which reduced PM-1's overall performance.

In an attempt to correct some of these original design oversights, several
modifications and additions have been made to the plant which have made it
virtually a stationary plant. Consequently, the Air Force now has a plant that
is neither portable nor easily maintainable or operable.

Factors that have resulted in this high cost of power production are
numerous; however, many of these costs could be reduced or brought into a
realistic value by equating a plant such as the PM-1 to a compatible mission.
The problems such as overmanning, excessive modification requirement, training
requirement due to the policy of giving maximum training to the majority of
the crew members, loss of personnel by premature transfers, operating the
plant below capacity, and excessive down time (especially during the first
2 years of operation for design improvement) have all added up to present a
dim economical picture of nuclear power production.
