            In the days after US President Eisenhower signed the Atomic Energy
            Act of 1954, which allowed civilians to own and operate commercial
            nuclear plants, a group of 10 New England utilities agreed to form a
            cooperative company tasked with building and operating a full-scale
            nuclear plant. The company was called the Yankee Atomic Electric
            Company, and they built and operated the Yankee Rowe reactor.

            The Yankee partners wanted to move fast, so they chose to use the
            same reactor model as the successful government-sponsored submarines
            and the under-construction Shippingport reactor: the Pressurized
            Water Reactor (PWR). They engaged the seasoned pros, Westinghouse
            and Stone & Webster to design and construct the reactor, the same
            exact team that was building Shippingport.

            Yankee was somewhat unique (along with Dresden) at the time in that
            it was privately financed. The sponsoring companies purchased stock
            providing 35% of the capital needs. Another 35% came from the sale
            of Yankee bonds to insurance companies, and then the remaining 30%
            came from unsecured 4.75% notes from 28 banks. Here's the reactor
            structure going up.

            The early, on-budget delivery, private financing, relatively
            high-burnup core, and relatively stable performance of Yankee
            provided the proof needed to inspire the wave of orders of LWRs that
            made up the current nuclear fleet. Conversely, many of the non-water
            reactors being prototyped at the time suffered serious operational
            challenges.
