We're excited to announce the world "re-premier" of two historic videos about
Nebraska's pioneering nuclear power experience with the Hallam Nuclear Power
Facility at the Sheldon Power Station.

The [Nebraska Public Power District](https://www.nppd.com/) has generously
sponsored the digitization of two early 1960s films about the historic Hallam
Nuclear Power Facility just south of Lincoln, NE. The films were sitting on 16mm
film at the National Archives for the past 60 years, and thanks to NPPD, are now
right here on the internet. Extra special thanks to John McClure, who drove me
down to Sheldon Station during the [2021 Nebraska Advanced Reactor
Forum](https://advancednuclearcoalition.org/forum/) and supported getting these
resources digitized, and to Scott Margheim for coordinating the digitization
efforts.

To celebrate these videos, we just added a new page [briefly summarizing the
Hallam story, and explaining what's so cool about sodium graphite reactors]({%
link sodium-graphite-reactors.md %}). In summary, they can produce
high-temperature heat (good for efficiency and industrial needs), with
low-pressure liquid metal sodium (good for emergency cooling without backup
power) without requiring above ~4% enrichment. The SGR is a nearly-forgotten
super-capable reactor that has significant operational experience. Hopefully
these videos will help us remember them.

The second film contains mostly the same footage as the first, but
in a condensed version.

Independently of whatisnuclear.com, NPPD also digitized two other Hallam videos that
are well worth watching:

and rolled several hundred yards through a corn field.

In other exciting news, NPPD has also been scanning photos from
the Sheldon Station office showing the construction and operation of the Hallam
reactor in even more thrilling detail. They have already sent us [hundreds
of photos from the Hallam decommissioning]({% link hallam-photos.md %}).
More to come on that!

This digitization effort kicked off after we found out about the existence of the Hallam
videos in a film catalog linked on [our ZPPR video page]({% link _news/2022-12-19-zppr-film-scanned.md %}).
There are lots more like this still.
