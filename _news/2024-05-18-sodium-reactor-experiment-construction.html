title: Construction of the Sodium Reactor Experiment

description: >
  The Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) was a prototype reactor 27 miles
  NW of LA that served as a technology demonstration of sodium-cooled,
  graphite-moderated reactors (aka SGRs). In the 1950s, it was thought
  that the combination of high-temperature, low-pressure liquid metal
  sodium coolant with highly fuel-conservative neutron moderation
  would form a likely candidate for low-cost commercial nuclear power
  plants.

            Then, as today, the best way to verify that your economic
            suppositions are anywhere near correct was to build and operate a
            prototype. Originally the SRE was going to dump all its heat to air,
            but they ended up hooking it up to generator and putting electricity
            on the local grid.

            To slow down the neutrons, moderators of graphite were used. They
            were surrounded by dimpled hexagonal zirconium cans to prevent the
            sodium from interacting with the graphite. Some of the moderator
            corners were scalloped to allow room for experimental channels and
            control rods. With moderated neutrons, SGRs can run on low-enriched
            or possibly even natural uranium, whereas fast-neutron reactors
            require higher enrichments (e.g. HALEU/MEU) or plutonium.

          Because sodium chemically reacts with air, you can't just open up the
          top to move fuel or do maintenance. Instead, SRE pioneered a rotating
          face shield (right) placed inside a stationary ring shield (left).
          Both were filled with dense concrete. Today this would be called the
          reactor head.

          This huge fuel handling machine could be coupled to the loading face.
          A fuel bundle would be picked up from the plug and lifted all the way
          up into the shielded cask. Then it could be moved out and replaced
          with a fresh assembly. In this sense, SRE pioneered a lot of the
          modern thinking and mechanisms in sodium-cooled reactor fuel handling.

          It is imperative to keep oxygen levels low in sodium-cooled reactors.
          Cold traps that precipitate out sodium oxide and hot traps that absorb
          oxygen into zirconium were developed to keep it below 2 ppm. Pictured
          here is a guy loading in a huge coil of corrugated zirconium into a
          hot trap.

          Much was learned at SRE, and a full-scale demonstration reactor of the
          SGR type was built and operated at Hallam, Nebraska based on its
          experience. The SRE became famous when tetralin leaked and clogged a
          channel, leading to fuel melt, and the SGR concept became unpopular.
          However, the capabilities of SGRs are strong. I found the pamphlet
          that all these photos came from on ebay and
