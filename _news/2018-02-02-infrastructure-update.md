# Changes behind the scenes with Jekyll and github (meta-post) 
##### 2018-02-02

### Old content revival 
We revived some of the older content
that never made the transition to our mobile-friendly site and a reorganization
of the top menu. You'll find a lot more to explore in there. 

### Github source
We're announcing the [whatisnuclear github site](https://github.com/whatisnuclear) where
we will be storing the source of this entire webpage as well as a collection
of outreach material that people build. The intent here is both to make it easier
for other nuclear experts to collaborate with us and add/modify/update content and
to have a common place to store and retrieve outreach material to help teach
people about nuclear energy. 

### New license
We've [licensed](/license.html) the site CC-BY-NC, which means you can share and copy 
the content as long as you credit us and link to us, but you can't directly sell it. 

### New site generator
We've started using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator 
behind the scenes here. This will help us change and maintain the site better, and 
it allows some neat new features, such as little navigation indicators 
in the top menu and back/next buttons at the bottom of each page to help 
readers know where they are. It will be easier for us to keep pages consistent now.
We also added this [blog](/blog/) section.
