        We should add more nuclear energy, or at least not shut down the nuclear power
        plants that we already have. There’s a strong movement to get rid of nuclear power
        plants which I think is not good.

        Nuclear is ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only
        carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day. The problems
        with today’s reactors, such as the risk of accidents, can be solved through
        innovation.

  #      You bring up an important part of our energy mix which is nuclear. This is
  #      absolutely a critical part of this conversation. One thing I would just like to
  #      clarify is that the Green New Deal does leave the door open for nuclear. You are
  #      right we name renewables like wind and solar specifically. The door is open for
  #      nuclear but we also have to make sure that community input and the technology is
  #      vetted. I do believe there is an open door there.

        We are holding this hearing because nuclear energy must be a national
        priority.  It provides about 20 percent of our nation’s electricity, and
        63 percent of our emissions-free electricity.  It is safe and extremely
        reliable.  When cold winters hit the Northeast and the flow of natural gas
        is restricted, nuclear plants continue to provide electricity to
        residents, literally saving lives.  When the wind isn’t blowing and the
        sun isn’t shining, nuclear is still providing essential baseload capacity.
        For any number of good reasons, nuclear has to remain part of the energy
        mix

        renewables for awhile until they find their way to nuclear.
