          Green energy alone is not enough to meet demand.  We need a mix. That's
          why I'm in favor of nuclear energy. For me it is one of the safest
          methods of generating power.

          Nuclear is ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only
          carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day. The problems
          with today’s reactors, such as the risk of accidents, can be solved through
          innovation.

  #      You bring up an important part of our energy mix which is nuclear. This is
  #      absolutely a critical part of this conversation. One thing I would just like to
  #      clarify is that the Green New Deal does leave the door open for nuclear. You are
  #      right we name renewables like wind and solar specifically. The door is open for
  #      nuclear but we also have to make sure that community input and the technology is
  #      vetted. I do believe there is an open door there.

          energy for the future. I think it’s natural to reexamine your beliefs as

          We are holding this hearing because nuclear energy must be a national
          priority.  It provides about 20 percent of our nation’s electricity, and
          63 percent of our emissions-free electricity.  It is safe and extremely
          reliable.  When cold winters hit the Northeast and the flow of natural gas
          is restricted, nuclear plants continue to provide electricity to
          residents, literally saving lives.  When the wind isn’t blowing and the
          sun isn’t shining, nuclear is still providing essential baseload capacity.
          For any number of good reasons, nuclear has to remain part of the energy
          mix

          has tremendous potential to be a big part of the solution.

          big companies are beginning to realize themselves that you can’t make money that
          way. What replaces it, I hope, is nuclear, but probably they’ll mess about with
          renewables for awhile until they find their way to nuclear.

          are not, its worldwide use as our main source of energy would pose an insignificant
          threat compared with the dangers of intolerable and lethal heat waves and sea levels
