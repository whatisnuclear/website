    It was really hip to be anti-nuclear between 1975 and 1995, and so
    most nuclear energy songs are anti-nuclear ones and come from this era.

        A super-chill tune all about the Fermi 1 accident where a liner
        of a core catcher broke off and blocked the coolant inlets of a 
        few assemblies, causing them to overheat and melt. Fermi 1
        was an early sodium-metal cooled fast neutron reactor.

        A nice folky song by one of my childhood favorite groups. This one prefers
        the comforting glow of the woodfire, never mind that biofuel combustion
        kills about 4 million people per year with air pollution, according to the
        WHO.

        The Ballad Of Nuke Power. I cripple and maim and cause death and decay"
