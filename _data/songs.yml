    It was really hip to be anti-nuclear between 1975 and 1995, and so
    most nuclear energy songs are anti-nuclear ones and come from this era.

      A nice folky song by one of my childhood favorite groups. This one prefers

      kills about 4 million people per year with air pollution, according to the
      WHO.
