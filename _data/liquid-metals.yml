- name: Mercury
  pros: Liquid at room temperature, non-reactive, common
  cons: Corrosive, toxic, poor heat transfer
  examples: Clementine
- name: Sodium-Potassium eutectic (NaK)
  pros: Liquid at room temperature, common, not corrosive, non-toxic
  cons: >
    Highly chemically reactive, high 14-hour induced radioactivity (it emits
    about 30,000x more radiation than water during operation and takes days
    rather than minutes to subside after shutdown)
  examples: EBR-1
- name: Sodium metal (Na)
  pros: Commercially available, cheap, non-toxic, non-corrosive
  cons: High 14-hour induced radioactivity, solid at room temperature, chemically reactive
  examples: Fermi-1, SRE, Hallam, EBR-2, SEFOR, FFTF, Phenix, SuperPhenix, BOR-60, BN-350, BN-600, BN800
- name: Lithium (Li-7)
  pros: Extremely good heat transfer, 5x smaller/lighter pumps than for Na
    {% cite unitedstatesAECAuthorizingLegislation1961a %}, Less chemically reactive
  cons: >
    Requires isotopic enrichment of lithium, expensive, medium corrosive, medium toxic,
    generates tritium
  examples: LCRE (concept and/or classified)
- name: Potassium
  pros: Cheap, non-corrosive, non-toxic
  cons: Chemically reactive
  examples: MPRE concept, SNAP-50 concept (secondary)
- name: Lead
  pros: Cheap, no induced radiation, low chemical reactivity, keeps fast neutrons moving fast
  cons: Toxic, corrosive, heavy, hard to pump, melts at relatively high temperature (327 °C)
  examples: BREST
- name: Bismuth
  pros: Keeps fast neutrons moving fast, low chemical reactivity, low toxicity
  cons: >
    Expensive, corrosive, melts at relatively high temperature (271 °C),
    activates to hazardous & volatile Po-210
  examples:
- name: Lead-Bismuth eutectic
  pros: Melts at convenient low temperature (125 °C), keeps fast neutrons moving fast
  cons: More expensive than lead, toxic, corrosive, activates to hazardous & volatile Po-210,
  examples: USSR Alfa-class submarines, K-27 submarine
- name: Cesium
  pros: Low corrosion, low toxicity
  cons: Expensive, chemically reactive
  examples:
