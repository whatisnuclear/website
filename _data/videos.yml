    This nontechnical, documentary film, for junior-high-school through
    college-level audiences, covers the historical background, and the design,
    construction, sea trials, and initial port calls of the N.S. Savannah, the
    world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The film begins with a brief
    review of America's maritime growth, starting with May 22,
    1819, and the story of the S.S. Savannah, the first ship to cross the ocean
    under steam power. The design of the N.S. Savannah and its atomic reactor and
    propulsion system are explained with animation and live action photography.
    After keel laying, various phases of the ship's construction are covered, and
    the assembling and testing of the reactor are explained. The ceremonies
    involving the launching of the ship are shown, followed by impressive scenes
    showing the loading of the reactor with its nuclear fuel under surgically clean
    conditions. The special training of the crew is reviewed. The film then shows
    the sea trials of the ship, during which time the reactor is slowly brought up
    to full power. After sea trials, the trip of the N.S. Savannah to her first port
    of call, Savannah, Georgia, is covered, followed by her voyage through the
    Panama Canal and visits to Hawaii and West Coast ports. As the ship leaves for
    foreign ports, the film ends with a statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson on
    the significance of the Nuclear Ship Savannah as a pioneer in the use of nuclear
    power for world trade to benefit all mankind.

    Cartoon on nuclear power. Measure of civilization is amount of power available
    to work for us. Power made from heat, mostly generated by burning coal or oil.
    In the future, from atomic fission. Atoms. The fission process. Radioactivity.
    Atomic core comprised of protons and neutrons. Binding energy holds it
    together. Electron shells. Atomic number. Atomic weight is sum of protons and
    neutrons. Varying the number of neutrons leads to isotopes of the same element.
    Most natural uranium is U-238, but it has high binding force and is not
    suitable for fuel. U-235 easier to split. Fission causes release of radiation
    and heat. Fermi produced first controlled chain reaction in 1942. U-238 can be
    changed to U-239, Thorium to U-233 by adding neutron to a fertile material
    (U-238 or Thorium), resulting in a fissionable material. This takes place in
    all reactors, but process is accelerated in a breeder reactor, which produces
    more fuel than it uses. Produced in co-operation with Niagara Mohawk.

    An animated documentary on atomic power from GE's "Excursions in Science"
    series.

    From the GE Film Catalog: "To most of us the recently unleashed giant of atomic
    energy represents an incredibly potent force for destruction - but it is
    becoming apparent that this super power can also be harnessed as a wonderworking
    servant, helping to bring about a new era of progress in the fields of industry,
    medicine, agriculture, and science.

    "Since the future of our world depends upon man's wisdom in the control of this
    force, an understanding of the elements of atomic energy is of prime importance
    to every American. This picture, therefore, has been designed to present a
    comprehensive, easily understandable explanation of the principles of nuclear
    fission in an interesting and entertaining manner.

    "Filmed in striking, full-color animation, the picture introduces an amusing
    character called Dr. Atom who takes the audience through "Element Town" to
    explain the atomic structure of the 92 basic elements. The film goes on to
    illustrate the process by which the energy within the atom is released
    through nuclear fission and the means of controlling this energy to supply
    power to a peacetime world."

    With coal , gas and oil in limited supply , where will we turn to satisfy our
    future expanding energy needs?  Some scientists believe it may be the
    thermonuclear process, called fusion, that powers the sun.  This fusing
    of atoms releases large amounts of energy.  Scientists at ERDA
    laboratories and elsewhere in the world are seeking to control the fusion
    process to generate electricity.  Dr. Robert L. Hirsch, Director of
    ERDA's Division of Controlled Thermonuclear Research, explains that fusion
    fuel-a form of hydrogen found in ordinary seawater-is virtually in
    limitless supply. But there are enormous technical problems yet to overcome.
    Fusion fuels must be heated to 100-million degrees to form a special kind of
    gas, called a plasma, so hot that no solid material can contain it.
    Scientists, therefore, have turned to magnetic fields as the fusion- plasma
    container. But what bottle shape will be most effective?  Dr. Harold Furth
    explains that at Princeton University doughnut-shaped magnetic bottles are
    being studied as a means of avoiding plasma leakage from ends in the effort
    to eventually develop a power-producing commercial fusion reactor. The
    film explains that fusion power stations would be safe, environmentally
    attractive, and could be located in heavily populated urban areas where
    power needs are the greatest. Dr. Hirsch notes other promising lines of
    research-for example: laser beams to trigger the fusion reaction without
    magnetic fields , or direct conversion of plasma energy into electrical
    energy. But there is much research yet to be done internationally before
    fusion power can be achieved on a commercial basis, hopefully before the
    turn of the century.

    Designed for high school through college-level audiences, this film surveys
    the role of the USAEC in guiding and supporting the nation's atomic energy
    programs. It reviews many of those programs, including both the peaceful
    applications of nuclear energy and those involved in national defense.  The
    film opens with a visit to the community of Buchanan, New York, site of
    Consolidated Edison's Indian Point atomic power station. The enlightened
    attitude of the community toward the atomic plant is revealed as the camera
    visits the mayor of the town, teachers and school children, housewives,
    businessmen and plant personnel. Following a review of the atom's place in
    national defense, the film goes into the mining of uranium and processing into
    fissionable materials.

    It then explores the broad role of the USAEC, briefly discussing the make-up of
    the Commission and showing an actual Commission meeting in session, as the
    Commissioners, General Manager and Director of Regulation engage in an important
    discussion involving aerospace safety. The USAEC 's responsibility in all facets
    of atomic safety is covered as the film shows the testing of a nuclear power
    source for a space satellite and the design and testing of a power reactor. The
    processing and storage of radioactive waste is discussed.

    After reviewing some aspects of the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives,
    including Projects Sedan and Gnome, the film next turns to a survey of
    radioisotopes and their many applications. Isotope production at Oak Ridge is
    shown. Some of the uses of radioisotopes in medicine are demonstrated at the
    hospital at USAEC's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Some agricultural
    applications of radioisotopes are shown, including the irradiation of the
    screwworm fly and the use of radiation for food preservation.

    The radioisotope as a source of power is covered during a brief review of the
    SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) program. After a visit to Brookhaven
    National Laboratory to explore some aspects of high energy physics at the
    Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, the film concludes with some statements by Dr.
    Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the USAEC, concerning the important future of the

    the USAEC's Plowshare Program for development of peaceful uses of nuclear
    explosives from its planning stage through the early months of the
    post-detonation period when scientists entered the man-created cavern.
    Project Gnome was an experiment under the technical direction of the Lawrence
    Radiation Laboratory involving the detonation on December 10, 1961, of a 3.1
    kiloton nuclear explosive in a chamber about 1200 feet below the earth's
    surface in the Salado Salt Basin, a thick subsurface salt bed about 25 miles
    southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The force of the explosion created an
    underground cavern which today measures about 170 feet across and almost 90
    feet high. Animation is used to explain the scope of Project Gnome and its
    integrated scientific and technical programs. Project Gnome, one of the most
    heavily instrumented nuclear detonations ever conducted, was designed to
    provide scientific and technical information on ive objectives: (1) To
    determine characteristics and physical effects of underground detonations in
    a salt medium; (2) to explore feasibility of converting energy produced into
    electricity; (3) to make neutron cross-measurements which would contribute
    to scientific knowledge; (4) to provide information on design of nuclear
    explosives for peaceful purposes; and, (5) to investigate the practicability
    of recovering useful radioisotopes. Topics covered: geological and safety
    considerations explored in selection of the Gnome site; drilling and
    construction of the shaft, underground access tunnel and shot chamber; the
    surface installations; special monitoring and other programs conducted to
    afford safety to the public; the seismic and radiological monitoring
    programs; principal equipment and instrumentation installation in support of
    the complex scientific experiments; the pre-shot news media tour; the
    surface movement above ground zero at the moment of detonation; the escape
    of vapor from the shaft; recovery of scientific data and equipment; and
    entry into the underground cavity in May 1962. Dr. Edward Teller, University
    of California nuclear physicist, discusses the objectives of the Plowshare
    Program and the preliminary results of Project Gnome in the opening and

    This film describes the use of radiation to eradicate the screwworm fly in the
    southeastern United States, an insect pest that had caused large losses to
    livestock owners. The film describes how the screwworm fly deposits its eggs
    in a cut or insect bite on the skin of a warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch
    to worms that feed on live flesh and then fall to the ground, where they
    burrow into the soil and change to pupae. Ten days later the fly emerges and
    mates, and the cycle continues. The film shows typical cases of screwworm
    infestation. Entomologists of the Agricultural Research Service suggested
    that since screwworm flies mate only once, if a method of sexually sterilizing
    flies could be found, eradication was possible. Since X ray was too ex-
    pensive, radioactive cobalt ( 60 Co) was selected to do the sterilization job.
    The plan was tested on the tiny island of Curasao off the coast of Venezuela,
    where sterilized male flies were released from aircraft in patterns over the
    island. In six months the pest was eliminated. Similar operations were
    followed in Florida and other southeastern states. A huge screwworm factory
    was built in Florida, where 50 million flies were reared and sterilized in a
    week, with pupae subjected to 8000 roentgens of gamma rays. Ten million
    sterilized male flies were airdropped on infested areas. Eventually the
    screwworm fly was brought under full control and largely eradicated.

    This film describes the development and use of compact nuclear power sources for
    space under the Atomic Energy Commission's Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power
    (SNAP) program. The film features the first use of atomic power in the nation's
    space effort and briefly covers the uses of SNAP devices on land and sea. By
    means of animation and models, the two basic concepts of the SNAP program are
    shown. In one approach the energy of decay from radioactive isotopes is used to
    generate electricity directly, without moving parts. This method is being
    developed for the USAEC by the Martin Company, the aerospace division of the
    Martin Marietta Corporation. A SNAP isotopic-power generator was launched on
    board the Navy's Transit navigation satellite in June 1961, marking the first
    use of nuclear power in space. The other SNAP approach uses, the heat from a
    compact nuclear-fission reactor to generate electricity by a turbogenerator
    system or by direct conversion. The nuclear reactor systems being developed by
    Atomics International, a division of North American Aviation, Inc., will provide
    from 500 to 60,000 watts of electricity in space for one year. They can provide
    power for a satellite network for worldwide communications, weather observation,
    and navigation. The film briefly summarizes the importance of the use of space
    in the areas of communications; weather observation; research; navigation;
    astronomy and exploration; and the consequent need, as space technology
    advances, for more compact electrical power sources. A detailed explanation is
    given of the isotopic-power source aboard the Transit-4A navigational satellite,
    which produces almost 3 electrical watts enough to power two of the satellite's
    four navigational radio transmitter systems for five years or more. The
    isotopic-powered navigation equipment is transmitting precise signals that are
    being received all over the globe. The operational Transit satellite system
    will provide navigational information from which aircraft and ships around the
    world will be able to fix their positions within 0.1 mile. The film reviews the
    various nuclear-reactor-powered units, including SNAP-2, which will provide
    3000 watts of electricity in space for one year; SNAP-10A, which will provide
    500 watts for one year; and SNAP-8, which will generate up to 60,000 watts and
    will pioneer electric propulsion in the U. S. space program. SNAP power systems
    in three satellites in 24-hr orbit around the earth could provide a worldwide TV
    network with multilingual audio channels. Safety factors and safety testing of
    both types of SNAP units are shown. Since the fuel of the isotopic devices is
    radioactive itself, the capsule has been designed to keep it sealed on the
    launching pad, during launch, and in orbit. The SNAP nuclear -reactor systems
    are being so designed that, after a useful long life in space, they will shut
    down, cool off radioactively for a long period, and finally burn up on reentry.
    The small amount of remaining activity will be widely dispersed safely in, the
    vast area of the outer atmosphere. SNAP systems also have uses in remote areas
    on land and sea. An unmanned generator that transmits weather data to
    permanent Canadian and U.S. weather stations is now in operation in the Canadian
    Arctic (see film "Atomic Weatherman"). A more powerful version of this unit,
    with a potential life of 10 years, is supplying power for an unmanned auto-
    matic weather station in the Antarctic. Other SNAP devices will be used for sea
    buoys, navigation beacons, and portable electric-power stations. The film also
    briefly summarizes some of the planned space efforts of the future which will
    use nuclear auxiliary power.

    This is a semitechnical film for high-school and college-level audiences.
    After showing the launching of a new satellite, which is being wholly powered
    by a nuclear generator, animation is used to explain the use of its isotopic
    generator to create power to run electronic equipment, recording equipment,
    and transmit data back to earth for analysis. The advantages of nuclear energy
    are shown over the use of chemical energy and solar energy. The principles of
    power generation by isotopic decay are explained, showing how thermocouples
    convert the decaying isotopes' heat directly to electricity. A comparison of
    the isotopes Plutonium-238 and Curium-242, both used in SNAP isotope power
    systems, is made. It discusses the design features of the SNAP-9A which are
    the result of 7 years of research. Safety tests of the isotope capsule,
    including explosion tests, fire tests, impact tests, and re-entry tests are
    shown.

  description: >
    Useful to both educated-lay-level and technical audiences, including high
    school and college groups, this film summarizes the parallel development of a
    family of fully shielded thermoelectric power converters and chemical
    processing of the radioisotope Strontium-90 fuel. Laboratory procedures are
    depicted for thermoelectric couple assembly into a compact operating system
    capable of converting heat energy into electrical current without the need for
    moving parts. Compacting of Strontium-90 raw material into ceramic titanate
    pellets and encapsulation of the fuel pellets into high strength metal
    containers are illustrated.

    Fully shielded Strontium-90 fueled, thermoelectric generators have been placed
    into operational service at remote outposts from north of the Arctic Circle to
    the South Pole. Developed by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission under the SNAP
    (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) program, they are now proving the
    feasibility of reliable, unattended electrical power production from heat
    generated by decay of radioisotopes.

    Installation of the SNAP -7 generator family to power unattended weather
    stations in Antarctica and the Gulf of Mexico, navigational aids to shipping in
    Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, deep sea acoustic research in the
    Atlantic Ocean is depicted by means of film footage obtained during actual
    installation and implantment at the operating sites.

    The film concludes with a description of current development work and
    predictions relating to the next generation of Strontium-90 thermoelectric
    power supplies for terrestrial uses.

    This film with an introduction by Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the U. S.
    Atomic Energy Commission useful for both popular-level and technical audiences
    describes the scheduled flight test in space of the 500-watt SNAP-10A nuclear
    space power system. SNAP-lOAwill be mated to the forward end of an Atlas-Agena
    booster system and launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Primary
    objective of the SNAPSHOT flight, a cooperative effort of the Atomic Energy
    Commission and the United States Air Force, is to obtain technical information
    and demonstrate the utility of nuclear reactor power systems for application in
    America's space programs. Atomics International is the U. S. Atomic Energy
    Commission's prime contractor for SNAP-10A development. Orbital startup and
    operation in space of the reactor and the thermoelectric power converter is
    explained by animation. Highlighted in this film is the extensive development
    and testing program which has resulted in the flight-ready SNAP-10A power
    system. A series of qualification system tests, including a full-scale nuclear
    system ground test in a simulated space environment, is reviewed and
    summarized. This series of tests duplicated the environments the flight
    system will endure through factory assembly, shipping, launch, and orbit
    operation. The film explains the need for SNAP reactor power systems in
    current and future space projects.

    The purpose of this film is to explain to junior and senior high-school
    students in biology, general science, or physics the meaning of high-energy
    radiation and to show how this radiation is used in biological research. To
    accomplish its objective, this film briefly reviews light from the sun (wave
    radiation), radio waves, X rays, etc. It also touches on the various sources
    of radiation (X-ray machines, nuclear reactors, cosmic rays, the sun, etc.).
    Radioisotopes are defined, and their life is traced from production through
    their use as tools in the study of radiation damage. The effect of radiation
    on living cells is demonstrated by comparisons of plants grown from irradiated
    and nonirradiated seeds and of mice that had been irradiated with those that
    had not been irradiated. The film also shows the effects of radiation on bone
    marrow, on the protective lining of the intestine, and on chromosomes 
    (mutations). The use of radioisotopes to trace chemical processes in plants (the
    absorption of nutrients) is also covered. Autoradiographs are explained, and
    the function of a Geiger counter is outlined. The film was made under the
    technical direction of Dr. Harvey Patt, Division of Biological and Medical
    Research at USAEC's Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and photographed at

    This film discusses the 14-month repair and restoration of the NRX Reactor at
    Chalk River, Ontario, following a rapid super operational power level
    excursion (the first nuclear reactor runaway in history) and describes the
    1959 safety system of the 40-Mw reactor. Film footage made during actual
    restoration is supplemented by studio explanation with a reactor model.
    Depicted are the unusual and hazardous problems complicating repairs: high
    levels of radioactive contamination in work areas; continuation of water
    cooling on high irradiated fuel rods to prevent auto-ignition; creation of
    disposal facilities in subzero weather for a gross quantity of cooling water
    mixed with highly active fission products; corrosion-inhibiting preservation
    of irradiated fuel rods; decontamination of large pieces of equipment and
    reactor components; and rebuilding a reactor that had not been designed
    initially for major repair. Illustrated are unique methods and tools for
    locating radioactive products lodged in piping and auxiliary equipment,
    snaring and removing broken pieces of radioactive fuel rods, suppressing large
    areas of residual building contamination, and removing and decontaminating
    equipment, shielding, and heavy water. In addition to persons interested in
    nuclear reactors, the film has particular value to reactor technology and
    operation for assessing safety system failure and associated problems and
    hazards of returning a reactor to operation.

    the seal of the inner metal container of radioactive material being broken.
    This technical film report shows the development and testing of the wooden
    containers as well as the buildup of the containers from rings of plywood.
    Photography of actual drop tests and fire tests is included to demonstrate
    the resistance of the container to both impact shock and fire exposure.
    Results of tests show that a container having six-inch thick shells of fir

    This film depicts the growing need for nuclear power and describes the
    features of heavy water reactors for use in power production. The development
    program conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission on this reactor concept is
    described in detail. Design studies performed on promising heavy water reactor
    concepts established the technical feasibility and economic promise of this
    concept. A number of research tasks in the fields of fuel design, engineering
    of low leakage components, studies of heat transfer and the physics of natural
    uranium heavy water systems were investigated in detail by Dupont and other
    research contractors to the USAEC. The facilities at the Savannah River
    Laboratory and at commercial laboratories used in this program are shown.

    Primary emphasis in the development program was placed on design of an
    inexpensive natural uranium fuel element for the heavy water reactor. Processes
    of fuel fabrication of both uranium metal and uranium oxide are described. To
    verify the results of the fuel development and other engineering programs a test
    reactor called a Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) was constructed at
    the Savannah River Plant. The film describes the construction of this reactor
    and outlines in detail the technical features and capabilities of the HWCTR and
    its special loop systems in demonstrating the heavy water reactor concept.

    Shows man's historic and growing hunger for water and

    the nuclear reactor as the energy source and the desalting plant as the fresh
    water source, tomorrow's coastal deserts may be transformed into self-sustaining
    mammoth nuclear powered agro industrial centers consisting farms and industrial
    plants. Nuclear power reactors will pump millions of gallons of water from the
    sea and provide the heat to desalt it. At the same time low cost nuclear energy
    will produce electricity to help extract and process the ocean's mineral wealth.
    Electricity from nuclear energy will power plants that produce fertilizers.
    Fertilizers and fresh, desalted water for irrigation will enrich lands where no
    crops have grown for centuries. Designed to convert waste lands into new lands of
    desert agriculture and to provide new industries and new jobs, the proposed Agro
    industrial complex will raise the standard of living for millions of people.

    This film introduces Eve as a little girl who needed electricity for many
    things. As she matured into a woman, her needs grew as her cooking and
    cleaning all required electricity. The film promotes nuclear energy as the
    solution to all Eve's household needs. Produced for the Connecticut Yankee
    Atomic Power Company. Includes scenes of Eve doing ballet while holding a
    lightbulb and looking in a microscope.

    This film describes an experiment at the National Reactor Testing
    Station, Idaho, in which aircraft reactor fuel elements, together with
    other materials, were melted in a simulated aircraft crash. The
    experiment consisted of two phases: the first (Phase A) used jet fuel
    as the combustible and the second (Phase B) used Thermite to produce
    high temperature to assure melting. In Phase A, melting did not occur,
    and no radioactivity was released. In Phase B, melting did occur, with
    the release of a small amount of activity (10,000 curies of fission
    products) in the National Reactor Testing Station out to a distance of
    V2 mile. The total experiment provided preliminary experimental data
    upon which to base further experiments and to make very preliminary
    estimates of the hazards of mobile reactors in an accident situation.
    (The film should be of interest to persons concerned with: the release
    of fission products from radioactive fuel elements when the element is
    completely melted; the results obtained by the destruction of fuel
    elements containing significant fission products; development of aircraft
    reactors; and generalized safety research. The film should be of
    particular interest to personnel associated with organic-moderated
    facilities in which fire hazard is a factor, radiological health and
    safety activities, the Radiological Assistance Program, etc

    As the nuclear power industry expands, the handling and ultimate
    disposal of high activity waste becomes of increasing importance.
    This technical film describes newly developed methods for solidifying
    high activity wastes, reducing their volume by a factor of 10, into
    solids that are almost chemically inert. The process includes pot and
    spray calcination, and the fluidized bed calciner with a capacity of 100
    liters per hour of liquid waste. Techniques being developed to produce
    glasslike solids from powdered wastes and directly from liquids are
    also shown. The use of salt mines for disposal of solid wastes is
    discussed.

  description: >
    This semitechnical film presents potential industrial applications of
    nuclear explosives that require amounts of packaged energy heretofore
    unavailable and suggests that nuclear explosives can be used as safely
    as chemical explosives, and with greater effect and at less cost. 
    Applications illustrated include harbor development, economical recovery of
    low-grade ore bodies, release of petroleum from oil shale, under-
    ground production of steam for generation of power, and development
    of large underground reservoirs in arid areas.
