    This nontechnical, documentary film, for junior-high-school through
    college-level audiences, covers the historical background, and the design,
    construction, sea trials, and initial port calls of the N.S. Savannah, the
    world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The film begins with a brief
    review of America's maritime growth, starting with May 22,
    1819, and the story of the S.S. Savannah, the first ship to cross the ocean
    under steam power. The design of the N.S. Savannah and its atomic reactor and
    propulsion system are explained with animation and live action photography.
    After keel laying, various phases of the ship's construction are covered, and
    the assembling and testing of the reactor are explained. The ceremonies
    involving the launching of the ship are shown, followed by impressive scenes
    showing the loading of the reactor with its nuclear fuel under surgically clean
    conditions. The special training of the crew is reviewed. The film then shows
    the sea trials of the ship, during which time the reactor is slowly brought up
    to full power. After sea trials, the trip of the N.S. Savannah to her first port
    of call, Savannah, Georgia, is covered, followed by her voyage through the
    Panama Canal and visits to Hawaii and West Coast ports. As the ship leaves for
    foreign ports, the film ends with a statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson on
    the significance of the Nuclear Ship Savannah as a pioneer in the use of nuclear
    power for world trade to benefit all mankind.

    This popular-level film, suitable for audiences from junior high school
    through college, discusses many aspects of radiation and offers a survey of
    their widespread beneficial applications in medicine, industry, agriculture,
    power, and research. A historical survey of the discovery of radiation is
    followed by an animated explanation of different types of radiation, including
    alpha, beta, and gamma. A brief explanation of radioisotopes and how they are
    produced is given, followed by scenes depicting some of their uses, including
    the use of Calcium-47 to diagnose bone cancer. The detection and study of
    radiation by sensitive instruments is explained. The study of radiation in the
    laboratory is demonstrated with work in photosynthesis using
    radiochromatography. Several important industrial uses of radiation are shown.
    The use of irradiation for prolonged food preservation, particularly of such
    highly perishable food as fresh fish, is demonstrated. The production of a new
    material, a wood-plastic alloy, is also shown as one example of current
    research in the beneficial uses of radiation.

    Designed for high school through college-level audiences, this film surveys
    the role of the USAEC in guiding and supporting the nation's atomic energy
    programs. It reviews many of those programs, including both the peaceful
    applications of nuclear energy and those involved in national defense.  The
    film opens with a visit to the community of Buchanan, New York, site of
    Consolidated Edison's Indian Point atomic power station. The enlightened
    attitude of the community toward the atomic plant is revealed as the camera
    visits the mayor of the town, teachers and school children, housewives,
    businessmen and plant personnel. Following a review of the atom's place in
    national defense, the film goes into the mining of uranium and processing into
    fissionable materials.

    It then explores the broad role of the USAEC, briefly discussing the make-up of
    the Commission and showing an actual Commission meeting in session, as the
    Commissioners, General Manager and Director of Regulation engage in an important
    discussion involving aerospace safety. The USAEC 's responsibility in all facets
    of atomic safety is covered as the film shows the testing of a nuclear power
    source for a space satellite and the design and testing of a power reactor. The
    processing and storage of radioactive waste is discussed.

    After reviewing some aspects of the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives,
    including Projects Sedan and Gnome, the film next turns to a survey of
    radioisotopes and their many applications. Isotope production at Oak Ridge is
    shown. Some of the uses of radioisotopes in medicine are demonstrated at the
    hospital at USAEC's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Some agricultural
    applications of radioisotopes are shown, including the irradiation of the
    screwworm fly and the use of radiation for food preservation.

    The radioisotope as a source of power is covered during a brief review of the
    SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) program. After a visit to Brookhaven
    National Laboratory to explore some aspects of high energy physics at the
    Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, the film concludes with some statements by Dr.
    Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the USAEC, concerning the important future of the
    nation's atomic energy program and the role the atom will play in benefiting
    all mankind.

    Describes SNAP-27, its mission and its role in the Apollo program. On an early
    Apollo flight, astronauts on the moon will install a small scientific
    laboratory to conduct lunar surface experiments. After they depart for earth,
    the laboratory—known as ALSEP, Apollo Lunar Surface Packages will remain,
    transmitting its research data to receiving stations on earth for several
    years. ALSEP is powered by electricity from atomic energy a highly reliable,
    radioisotope-fueled thermoelectric generator called SNAP-27. The film
    explains how tiny grains of radioactive plutonium-238 in a sealed fuel
    capsule generate heat which, in turn, generates electricity directly by means
    of thermocouples. In simulated action on earth, we see astronauts unloading 
    ALSEP and inserting the nuclear fuel capsule. The film discusses the type of
    lunar surface information in the radioisotope-powered ALSEP will send back 
    to earth, and the temperature and stresses and vibration tests to which SNAP-27 has
    been subjected. Technology developed for SNAP-27 also will be of assistance
    to the aircraft and other industries.

    This film covers Project Gnome the first nuclear detonation conducted under
    the USAEC's Plowshare Program for development of peaceful uses of nuclear
    explosives from its planning stage through the early months of the
    post-detonation period when scientists entered the man-created cavern.
    Project Gnome was an experiment under the technical direction of the Lawrence
    Radiation Laboratory involving the detonation on December 10, 1961, of a 3.1
    kiloton nuclear explosive in a chamber about 1200 feet below the earth's
    surface in the Salado Salt Basin, a thick subsurface salt bed about 25 miles
    southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The force of the explosion created an
    underground cavern which today measures about 170 feet across and almost 90
    feet high. Animation is used to explain the scope of Project Gnome and its
    integrated scientific and technical programs. Project Gnome, one of the most
    heavily instrumented nuclear detonations ever conducted, was designed to
    provide scientific and technical information on ive objectives: (1) To
    determine characteristics and physical effects of underground detonations in
    a salt medium; (2) to explore feasibility of converting energy produced into
    electricity; (3) to make neutron cross-measurements which would contribute
    to scientific knowledge; (4) to provide information on design of nuclear
    explosives for peaceful purposes; and, (5) to investigate the practicability
    of recovering useful radioisotopes. Topics covered: geological and safety
    considerations explored in selection of the Gnome site; drilling and
    construction of the shaft, underground access tunnel and shot chamber; the
    surface installations; special monitoring and other programs conducted to
    afford safety to the public; the seismic and radiological monitoring
    programs; principal equipment and instrumentation installation in support of
    the complex scientific experiments; the pre-shot news media tour; the
    surface movement above ground zero at the moment of detonation; the escape
    of vapor from the shaft; recovery of scientific data and equipment; and
    entry into the underground cavity in May 1962. Dr. Edward Teller, University
    of California nuclear physicist, discusses the objectives of the Plowshare
    Program and the preliminary results of Project Gnome in the opening and
    closing scenes.

    This film describes the use of radiation to eradicate the screwworm fly in the
    southeastern United States, an insect pest that had caused large losses to
    livestock owners. The film describes how the screwworm fly deposits its eggs
    in a cut or insect bite on the skin of a warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch
    to worms that feed on live flesh and then fall to the ground, where they
    burrow into the soil and change to pupae. Ten days later the fly emerges and
    mates, and the cycle continues. The film shows typical cases of screwworm
    infestation. Entomologists of the Agricultural Research Service suggested
    that since screwworm flies mate only once, if a method of sexually sterilizing
    flies could be found, eradication was possible. Since X ray was too ex-
    pensive, radioactive cobalt ( 60 Co) was selected to do the sterilization job.
    The plan was tested on the tiny island of Curasao off the coast of Venezuela,
    where sterilized male flies were released from aircraft in patterns over the
    island. In six months the pest was eliminated. Similar operations were
    followed in Florida and other southeastern states. A huge screwworm factory
    was built in Florida, where 50 million flies were reared and sterilized in a
    week, with pupae subjected to 8000 roentgens of gamma rays. Ten million
    sterilized male flies were airdropped on infested areas. Eventually the
    screwworm fly was brought under full control and largely eradicated.

    This film describes the development and use of compact nuclear power sources for
    space under the Atomic Energy Commission's Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power
    (SNAP) program. The film features the first use of atomic power in the nation's
    space effort and briefly covers the uses of SNAP devices on land and sea. By
    means of animation and models, the two basic concepts of the SNAP program are
    shown. In one approach the energy of decay from radioactive isotopes is used to
    generate electricity directly, without moving parts. This method is being
    developed for the USAEC by the Martin Company, the aerospace division of the
    Martin Marietta Corporation. A SNAP isotopic-power generator was launched on
    board the Navy's Transit navigation satellite in June 1961, marking the first
    use of nuclear power in space. The other SNAP approach uses, the heat from a
    compact nuclear-fission reactor to generate electricity by a turbogenerator
    system or by direct conversion. The nuclear reactor systems being developed by
    Atomics International, a division of North American Aviation, Inc., will provide
    from 500 to 60,000 watts of electricity in space for one year. They can provide
    power for a satellite network for worldwide communications, weather observation,
    and navigation. The film briefly summarizes the importance of the use of space
    in the areas of communications; weather observation; research; navigation;
    astronomy and exploration; and the consequent need, as space technology
    advances, for more compact electrical power sources. A detailed explanation is
    given of the isotopic-power source aboard the Transit-4A navigational satellite,
    which produces almost 3 electrical watts enough to power two of the satellite's
    four navigational radio transmitter systems for five years or more. The
    isotopic-powered navigation equipment is transmitting precise signals that are
    being received all over the globe. The operational Transit satellite system
    will provide navigational information from which aircraft and ships around the
    world will be able to fix their positions within 0.1 mile. The film reviews the
    various nuclear-reactor-powered units, including SNAP-2, which will provide
    3000 watts of electricity in space for one year; SNAP-10A, which will provide
    500 watts for one year; and SNAP-8, which will generate up to 60,000 watts and
    will pioneer electric propulsion in the U. S. space program. SNAP power systems
    in three satellites in 24-hr orbit around the earth could provide a worldwide TV
    network with multilingual audio channels. Safety factors and safety testing of
    both types of SNAP units are shown. Since the fuel of the isotopic devices is
    radioactive itself, the capsule has been designed to keep it sealed on the
    launching pad, during launch, and in orbit. The SNAP nuclear -reactor systems
    are being so designed that, after a useful long life in space, they will shut
    down, cool off radioactively for a long period, and finally burn up on reentry.
    The small amount of remaining activity will be widely dispersed safely in, the
    vast area of the outer atmosphere. SNAP systems also have uses in remote areas
    on land and sea. An unmanned generator that transmits weather data to
    permanent Canadian and U.S. weather stations is now in operation in the Canadian
    Arctic (see film "Atomic Weatherman"). A more powerful version of this unit,
    with a potential life of 10 years, is supplying power for an unmanned auto-
    matic weather station in the Antarctic. Other SNAP devices will be used for sea
    buoys, navigation beacons, and portable electric-power stations. The film also
    briefly summarizes some of the planned space efforts of the future which will
    use nuclear auxiliary power.

    This is a semitechnical film for high-school and college-level audiences.
    After showing the launching of a new satellite, which is being wholly powered

    generator to create power to run electronic equipment, recording equipment,
    and transmit data back to earth for analysis. The advantages of nuclear energy
    are shown over the use of chemical energy and solar energy. The principles of
    power generation by isotopic decay are explained, showing how thermocouples
    convert the decaying isotopes' heat directly to electricity. A comparison of
    the isotopes Plutonium-238 and Curium-242, both used in SNAP isotope power
    systems, is made. It discusses the design features of the SNAP-9A which are
    the result of 7 years of research. Safety tests of the isotope capsule,
    including explosion tests, fire tests, impact tests, and re-entry tests are

    accomplish its objective, this film briefly reviews light from the sun (wave
    radiation), radio waves, X rays, etc. It also touches on the various sources
    of radiation (X-ray machines, nuclear reactors, cosmic rays, the sun, etc.).
    Radioisotopes are defined, and their life is traced from production through
    their use as tools in the study of radiation damage. The effect of radiation
    on living cells is demonstrated by comparisons of plants grown from irradiated
    and nonirradiated seeds and of mice that had been irradiated with those that
    had not been irradiated. The film also shows the effects of radiation on bone
    marrow, on the protective lining of the intestine, and on chromosomes 
    (mutations). The use of radioisotopes to trace chemical processes in plants (the
    absorption of nutrients) is also covered. Autoradiographs are explained, and

  description: >
    This semitechnical film surveys the current widespread uses of radio-
    isotopes throughout American industry. Three major areas of use are
    described: nuclear gauging (thickness, density, and level), radiography, and
    tracing with various examples of each filmed at 26 sites nation-wide,
    including the rubber industry, thin strip metal production, plastics,
    paper mills, nylons, food canning, cement, submarine construction, oil
    industry, automobiles, etc. Covered briefly are luminescence, static
    elimination, isotopic power, and uses of high-intensity radiation. Basic
    principles are explained by animation, followed by examples of in-plant
    uses. Benefits to the consumer and manufacturer are high-lighted. The
    excellent safety record is noted. The film, although of interest to a wide
    audience, is designed to acquaint industrial management with the
    versatility, economy, and ease with which radioisotope techniques can be
    adapted to plant requirements

  color: true
  description: >
    This popular-level film, narrated by news commentator John Daly, surveys the
    widespread use of radioisotopes by American industry to make better products
    from ships to nylon hose more efficiently and with an impressive record of
    safety. By means of animation and live action, the film explains what
    radioisotopes are and how they are used to (1) measure and control the
    thickness of sheet materials, (2) measure densities of materials, (3)
    control product quality, (4) increase flexibility and mobility of industrial
    radiography (taking X-ray type pictures to assure safe construction), and
    (5) act as tracers to follow physical movement and chemical reactions.
    Examples are given of thickness gauges of nylon cord-rubber ply for
    automobile tires, sheet plastic, and cord-rolled alloy sheets for computers
    and space-age instruments, as well as examples of gauges which measure
    densities without shutdown (such as gauges that measure sugar content in
    applesauce, fat content, and moisture content in soil) and which measure
    the level of liquids in cans. Industrial radiography with radioisotopes is
    illustrated with the work on submarines. Uses of radioisotope tracers are
    explained for engine-wear studies, product movement in oil pipelines, leak
    detection in pipelines, etc.  status: Not digitized
