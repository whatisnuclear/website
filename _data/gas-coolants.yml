- name: Air
  wq: 11.9
  pros: "Common, cheap"
  cons: "Poor heat transfer, corrosive due to oxygen, activates to radioactive Ar-41, N-16, and C-14"
  examples: "CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, X-10, Windscale, HTREs"
- name: Nitrogen
  wq: 11.9
  pros: "Common, cheap"
  cons: "Poor heat transfer, embrittles materials via nitriding"
  examples: "GCRE, ML-1"
- name: Steam
  wq: 2.65
  pros: "Common, cheap"
  cons: "Corrosive, activates to Ar-41 and N-16"
  examples: "Steam cooled fast reactor concepts"
- name: Carbon dioxide
  wq: 4.84
  pros: "Common, cheap"
  cons: "Radioactive C-14 builds up in loop, N-16 present during operation"
  examples: "Calder Hall, UNGG, Magnox, AGR, EL4, Lucens"
- name: Helium
  wq: 5.1
  pros: "Good heat transfer, chemically inert, low activation"
  cons: "Uncommon, expensive, difficult to contain"
  examples: "THTR, Peach Bottom, HTTR, Dragon, AVR, UHTREX"
- name: Hydrogen
  wq: 0.91
  pros: "Good heat transfer, common, cheap"
