        As a young nuclear engineer, I was enchanted by Alvin Weinberg's autobiography,
        The First Nuclear Era. He took me through a very personal history of concepts I
        have studied, and struck many chords by recounting such things as the day the term
        "breeder reactor" was thought up. Weinberg discusses pioneering neutron transport,
        working with the Manhattan Project, the origins of the national labs, how he
        influenced today's dominance of light-water reactors, and a history of the various
        goings on that brought nuclear power to where it is today.

        This report summarizes the available domestic and international
        operating experience (OpE) for both power and research advanced
        non-light-water reactors with regard to materials and component
        integrity. It focuses on both sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) and
        high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs).
