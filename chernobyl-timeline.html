          Normal operation: reactor was at full power. Steam power was directed
          to both turbines of the power generators. The purpose of the test was
          to determine if one of the turbines could supply power to feedwater
          pumps until standby diesel generators came on line in the case of a
          local power failure.

          In preparation for the test prior to routine shutdown, reactor power
          was powered down to 1600 MWt for a test sequence. Now only one turbine
          was needed to take in the decreased amount of steam from the reduced
          power and one of the turbines was switched off.

          The test was designed to be conducted at 22%-32% full power. However
          the demand in electricity was still high at the time, and authorities
          asked to keep the reactor at at 50% power for additional 9 hours.

          Permission was received to resume the reactor power reduction. One of
          the operators failed to reprogram computer to maintain the power at
          30%, which caused the power to fall down to 1% and reactor was filled
          with solid water (no boiling) - an extremely unstable situation
          because of the positive void coefficient. This amount of power was too
          low to conduct the test.

          To try to bring the power back to the desired level operator pulled
          number of control rods out of the core (less than 26 control rods
          remaining in the core), but the power only increased to 7%, still well
          below the test design value. The reason the power could not be brought
          back up was the "xenon poisoning" effect. Xenon is a decay product of
          I-135 and is a strong neutron absorber which "poisons" the fission
          reaction. It reaches an equilibrium at normal operating power levels
          by being "burned away" by neutron absorption and further decay. When
          the power level was decreased from the 1600 MW level, there were lots
          of I-135 to decay into xenon, but a small neutron flux with which to
          burn it away, so it built up rapidly.

          In order to keep reactor from automatically shutting down under these
          conditions, emergency core cooling system (ECCS) and several of the
          automatic scram circuits were disconnected. More control rods were
          pulled out to overcome &quot;xenon poisoning&quot;. 6 control rods
          were still remaining on the core. At this point reactor could not be
          shut down rapidly if needed.

          All eight cooling water pumps were running at the low power, compared
          to a normal six even at full power, so there was nearly solid water
          with almost no void fraction, which increased the vulnerability to any
          power excursion which produced boiling.

          The turbine was tripped to initiate the test, which caused the
          switching off of four of the eight recirculation pumps. This would
          have scrammed the reactor if the automatic scram circuit had not been
          disconnected.

          Reduced coolant flow caused voids to form rapidly in the pressure
          tubes, increasing reactivity because of the positive void coefficient.
          The higher reactivity produced more steam. As the system fed itself,
          heat production soared, casing uncontrollable steam generation.

          Operator, recognizing an emergency, hit the button that was to lower
          all control rods into the core and shut down the reactor.

          Ironically, this last attempt was the final straw. The reactor system
          had a design problem that no one had foreseen. The control rods had
          six-inch graphite tips at their lead ends. These tips enter the core
          before the boron carbide section. As they enter the core, they
          displace water, which is essentially displacing absorber with
          moderator. Being inserted all at once they caused power to increase
          for a few seconds. Under normal operating conditions, this small
          temporary increase has little effect. But Chernobyl Reactor Number
          Four was not operating under normal conditions. As control rod tips
          entered the core, power surged to 100 times normal in four seconds.

          Under intense heat, the core began to break down. Fuel assemblies
          fragmented, control rod channels warped, steam built up furiously and,
          finally, steam tubes burst. Tons of steam and water shot into the
          reactor, causing a tremendous steam explosion. Steam pressure blew the
          1000-ton steel- and cement-filled biologic shield off the top of the
          reactor, destroying the roof of the reactor building along the way and
          exposing the hot core to the atmosphere.
