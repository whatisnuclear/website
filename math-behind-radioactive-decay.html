      This page derives the basic equation of radioactive decay. This equation
      allows us to figure out how many radioactive atoms are left after any
      amount of time. There are many general forms of the equation that deal
      with chains of nuclides, but here we only worry about the basics. WARNING:
      there is a little bit of calculus involved.

    <h1>Number of atoms at any given time</h1>

    <p>
      We start by noting that the speed of radioactive decays occurring in a
      sample is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms in the sample.
      This isn&rsquo;t hard to believe. If you had 10 jumping beans and saw one
      jump every second, you&rsquo;d expect to see about 10 jumps per second if
      you had 100. Mathematically, we represent this as
      $$-\frac{dN}{dt}=N\lambda$$ where \(\frac{dN}{dt}\) is the number of
      decays per second the batch of atoms is undergoing, \(N\) is the current
      number of radioactive atoms, and \(\lambda\) is a constant (called the
      decay constant) which is characteristic of any particular radioactive atom
      representing the likelihood that any individual atom will decay at any
      given time. Atoms that decay faster have larger decay constants, and so
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know the rate at which our sample is decaying, we can
      integrate this rate to figure out the total number of atoms that have
      decayed at any given time. Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t just multiply by
      time because the decay rate is changing as the number of atoms changes. So
      we&rsquo;re forced to use calculus. Here we go, step-by-step: $$
      \begin{aligned} \frac{dN}{N} &amp;= -\lambda dt &amp;&amp; \text{Rearrange
      to get } N \text{ on one side}\\ \int_{N_0}^{N} \frac{dN}{N} &amp;=
      -\lambda \int_{t=0}^t dt &amp;&amp; \text{Integrate over the interval of
      interest}\\ \text{ln}\left({N}\right)-\text{ln}\left(N_0\right) &amp;=
      -\lambda t &amp;&amp; \text{Evaluate the integrals}\\
      \text{ln}\left(\frac{N}{N_0}\right) &amp;= -\lambda t &amp;&amp; \text{Use
      log rules to combine the left-hand side}\\ \frac{N}{N_0} &amp;=
      e^{-\lambda t} &amp;&amp; \text{Take } e \text{ to the power of both
      sides}\\ N &amp;= N_0 e^{-\lambda t} &amp;&amp;\text{Multiply both sides
      by } N_0\\ \end{aligned}$$ Note: \(N_0\) is the number of nuclides at time
      \(t=0\).
    </p>

    <h1>Relating the half-life to the decay constant</h1>
    <p>
      Excellent. The final equation there is the well-known radioactive decay
      equation. But what should we use for \(\lambda\)? You may have heard of
      the concept of half-life, or \(\tau_{1/2}\). It&rsquo;s the time it takes
      for a batch of radioactive atoms to decay away, i.e. the lifetime of half
      of the atoms. We can relate \(\tau_{1/2}\) to \(\lambda\) easily using the
      formula derived above. We just say we start with \(N_0=100\) atoms and
      calculate the \(t\) it takes for this to drop to \(N=50\). $$\begin{align}
      50 &amp;= 100 e^{-\lambda \tau_{1/2}} &amp;&amp;\text{Plug in desired
      values, and } t=\tau_{1/2}\\ \left(\frac{50}{100}\right) &amp;=
      e^{-\lambda \tau_{1/2}} \\ \left(\frac{100}{50}\right) &amp;= e^{\lambda
      \tau_{1/2}} &amp;&amp; \text{Take reciprocal of both sides}\\ \text{ln}(2)
      &amp;= \lambda \tau_{1/2} &amp;&amp;\text{Take the ln of both sides}\\
      \lambda &amp;= \frac{\text{ln}(2) }{\tau_{1/2}} &amp;&amp; \text{Obtain
      expression for } \lambda \text{ vs. half-life}\\ \end{align}$$

      As a visual example of how nuclide populations change with different
      half-lives, take a look at this figure below. All nuclides start out with
      100% of their atoms. The blue curve represents a nuclide that has a
      50-year half-life. As you can see, it reaches 50% at exactly 50 years.
      Compare this with the green curve, which represents a nuclide with a
      100-year half-life. It crosses 50% exactly at 100 years. And so on.

    <h1>Population of daughter nuclides</h1>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s often useful to know the population of a decay product of a
      radioactive decay (also known as a daughter nuclide). These may be useful
      for radiogenic dating of objects (like the Earth), understanding nuclear
      waste behavior, etc. Let the number of daughter nuclides at \(t=0\) be
      \(D_0\). Then, $$ \begin{align} D &amp;= D_0 + N_0 - N
      &amp;&amp;\text{Because } N_0 - N \text{ parent nuclides decayed}\\ &amp;=
      D_0 + N_0 -N_0 e^{-\lambda t} &amp;&amp;\text{Plugging in the decay
      equation}\\ &amp;= D_0 + N_0\left(1-e^{-\lambda t} \right)
      &amp;&amp;\text{Final form based on } N_0\\ &amp;\text{or, if you want a
      formula based}\\ &amp;\text{on current parent population, } N\\ &amp;= D_0
      + Ne^{\lambda t}\left(1-e^{-\lambda t} \right)&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;= D_0 + N
      \left(e^{\lambda t}-1 \right)&amp;&amp; \text{Alternate form based on
      current } N\\ \end{align}$$

      An example of Uranium-238 (with a 4.47 billion year half-life) decaying
      into Lead-206 is shown in Figure 2, where we assume \(D_0 = 0\). Notice
      that the sum of these two curves is always 1.0.
