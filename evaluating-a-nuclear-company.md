It's an exciting time in the nuclear industry. Public and political support are
higher than they've been for years. Private sector investment is soaring, and
startup companies are appearing at record pace. With so much activity comes a need
for better tools to help us all understand the status and differences between
projects.

This page contains some rubrics for assessing the maturity and status
of nuclear projects. It may be useful for:

* Government and/or private investors performing due diligence on nuclear reactor vendors
* Nuclear startup companies plotting a roadmap for their own maturity
* Nuclear professionals choosing which nuclear company to join
* Power customers evaluating reactor vendors

You can design a series of questions that will place any given organization in 
a specific box for each row and then rank organizations by their total score.

## Experimental Capabilities

Besides ensuring that your design solutions will work as expected in the real
world, doing experimental and lab work is key for ensuring you fully understand
the nuances and challenges of your reactor environment. (See [this May 2025
letter](https://www.ans.org/news/2025-05-08/article-6961/hightemperature-plumbing-and-advanced-reactors/)
for more explanation from the advanced reactor point of view.)

## Analysis Capabilities

Analysis capabilities are the mathematical/computational manifestation of a
team's understanding of their reactor. Such tools can run a reactor idea though
thousands of design iterations, perturbations, and simulated accident scenarios
for relatively little money, and with no risk to health or the environment. You
can tell a lot about a reactor's maturity by understanding the tools and methods
the design team use to probe and optimize the design.


## Process and QA

Doing the right work is one thing, but doing the work right is another!



## Supply Chain

To build a nuclear plant, you need to make sure you can get all the parts you need.


## Legal and Regulatory Readiness

Having all the treaties, licenses, and permits lined up is obviously a big part of 
any nuclear build.

## Project Management

## Operations and Maintenance

* Operators trained and licensed on your plant (maybe trained by a training simulator based on the design)

## Typical design lifecycle stages

### Idea phase

* Do hand-calcs
* Run simple MCNP calcs and have a retired nobel prize winner review them (for clout)
* Make PowerPoints
* Talk big online

### Pre-conceptual design

During pre-conceptual design, a reactor idea is subjected to numerous trade studies to establish 
appropriate design solutions to the project objectives. It involves:

* Building multidisciplinary analysis capabilities capable of evaluating design solutions
  in terms of performance and cost
* Using the tools to figure out the optimal reactor design parameters: power, fuel type, reactor configuration,
  dimensions, notional interfaces between all required systems
  * This involves multiobjective optimization, as performance and cost parameters will be conflicting
* Performing tests on low-readiness enabling technologies (non-nuclear, or with a nuclear reactor experiment)
  * These give information needed to properly optimize the design of the reactor product
* Establishing hands-on familiarity with the prototypic (often non-nuclear) versions of the equipment,
  materials, fluids, systems called for by the design

Note that if you do decide to perform a reactor experiment, you will likely need to kick off a 
smaller sub-project that goes through all these phases and then return here for the reactor
product after you obtain the necessary information.


### Conceptual design

Some expected deliverables from conceptual design are shown in attachment 2 of
[Conceptual and Preliminary Design Implementation Guidance for National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) Capital Line Item
Projects](https://engstandards.lanl.gov/esm/general/Raines-memo-2018-5-1.df)

### Preliminary design

Some expected deliverables from preliminary design are shown in attachment 3 of
[Conceptual and Preliminary Design Implementation Guidance for National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) Capital Line Item
Projects](https://engstandards.lanl.gov/esm/general/Raines-memo-2018-5-1.df)

### Detailed design

### Construction 

### Production design

As a reactor product is built and operated, various issues and challenges will inevitably be
encountered. The design will be adjusted slightly by the owner as equipment is swapped out 
or adjusted during maintenance and operation. This evolving design during operation may 
be called production design. Depending on the severity of the challenges, an updated
design may be called for for future units. This may required updating licensing documents
and undergoing another round of design certification.

## Design Deliverables

An exciting-sounding reactor concept can inspire and motivate a team and investors. 
It's useful to chart a path through the design activities and deliverables.

Before you can build and operate a nuclear power plant, you need to design it. 
You will need to have:

* An operational and audited nuclear quality assurance program

* Design basis documents proving that the design solutions you've specified will
  perform as expected in all anticipated operational occurrences and design basis
  accidents. Also include best-estimate confirmation that they perform reasonably
  even in beyond design basis accidents
  * This requires a detailed list of initiating events and analysis of the event trees
    that happen based on them
  * Large seismic events are often challenging to survive and analyze
  * If you're using a nuclear fuel in conditions that don't have as much experimental basis,
    you need to perform irradiation testing and transient experiments, e.g. in TREAT
  * If you're using specialized equipment in uncommon conditions, you need to validate its
    performance in DBA conditions experimentally and fill in the gaps analytically
  * It's a rich tradition to not include enough radiation shielding, leading to rework.
    Assume 7-9 ft. of dense concrete + multiple layers of 4"-thick lead/tungsten or equivalent for starters.


* Technical specifications describing the allowable operating parameters for all equipment

* List of equipment needed with detailed specifications that satisfy the design
  basis, along with where you will buy it from/who will make
  it/how much it will cost

* Process flow diagrams

* Piping and Instrument diagrams

* Electrical one-line diagrams

* Location of concrete embeds

* Manufacturing drawings and detailed specifications for all custom parts in the reactor informed by vendors
  in the supply chain (or your internal machinists) who have confirmed that the
  parts can be made economically and at the required scale
  * Includes fuel. Ensure you have a pathway to get nuclear fuel enriched and fabricated
    to specification

* A site and appropriate financing to build on it, and a supportive surrounding community (or no population)

* Site preparation documents: what roads, train-line, transmission lines, water
  sources, effluent pathways will you need? Where exactly will they be, how deep do you need 
  to dig down, what capacity do the roads need to have? How will you get equipment to the site?

* Licenses and permits from all active regulatory bodies in the locality of the site, including
  international (IAEA), national (NRC, EPA), state, local, and industry (e.g. INPO).

* Construction procedures describing how to build everything, and in what order. What temporary
  construction structures and equipment need to be installed/moved/removed, and when?

* Operating procedures describing how to operate the plant

* Operators trained and licensed on your plant (maybe trained by a training simulator based on the design)

Given all that, you are ready to build!

The pathway taken to get these varies, but it's common to break the work needed down into several
design phases. Everyone has different definitions of the design phases, and there's
no precise definition. But some institutions, like the US DOE, have promulgated guidance that
does a pretty good job of listing out the activities and deliverables expected, at least in
the Conceptual and Preliminary design phases.
