# How much power could the sun give us?

<img class="float-end" src="/img/trees_sunshine.jpg" alt="Trees and sunshine" title="Trees and sunshine" />

The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor contained by gravity. It emits unfathomable amounts of energy.
This [map](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/assets/images/solar-annual-dni-2018-01.jpg) of the power that
comes to the USA each day (averaged over the year) has been compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It shows
that the average power incident on the US is around 6 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day. To put this in
perspective, notice that this means that the surface of the USA on average receives
7x10<sup>22</sup> <a href="{% link power-basics.md %}">Joules</a> of energy / year<sup>[<a

'Note', 'content', 'To do this calculation, first convert 6 kWh/m^2/day to W/m^2 ( type 6.0
kWh/m^2/day in W/m^2 into Google), then multiply by the area of the USA (see Wikipedia) to get the
total power in watts of the sun on the USA. Then, multiply this power by the number of seconds in a
year. Remember, a watt is a Joule/second.','trail', true);">*</a>]</sup>. In 2007, the entire power
consumption of the USA was about 1.4x10<sup>19</sup> J. This means that <b>there is about 5400x the
energy we use coming down from the sun.</b> Clearly there is more than enough solar power available.
This would, of course, require that the entire USA was covered head to toe with solar panels. Since
we don't need 5400x the energy we use, we could shrink the area down by this factor. Running the
numbers shows that if we covered something just 1% the size of Texas with 30% efficient solar
panels, we'd have all of our power from solar power.

## Pros and Cons of Solar Power

### Pros

Solar power is a very ideal power source. We can capture it passively with solar panels or other
collectors. Once the collectors are manufactured, there is no pollution or waste products. There are
no moving parts to hurt wildlife. There is no dependence on foreign entities. The energy is produced
and delivered for free by the sun.

### Cons

The sun doesn't shine at night. This means that in order to power our factories and hospitals
through the dark periods, we can't rely on the sun alone without somehow storing <a
href="{% link scale.md %}">massive amounts of energy</a>. Solar panels take up a lot of space. In
overcrowded cities where power consumption is highest and space is scarcest, building massive banks
of solar panels could be very challenging indeed. The solar panels and collectors traditionally need
banks of expensive chemical batteries and controls that make the cost of using solar power higher
than the same amount of power would cost coming from fossil fuels or nuclear power.

As an example of cost of solar power, consider covering 1% of Texas (or 90% of Delaware) with solar
panels. Today, a 10% efficient panel costs about $600/m<sup>2</sup>. Let's assume that technological
advances will allow us to manufacture 30% efficient panels for the same cost soon. At that price, it
would cost $3.6 trillion for the solar panels alone, not including the real-estate, battery packs,
and infrastructure. Today's solar panels are sold with a design lifetime of around 26 years, meaning
we would have to re-manufacture the panels every several decades. With that money, we could build
over 900 nuclear power plants at $4 billion and 1000MW each. That many plants would produce twice as
much energy as we use in a year, and they have lifetimes of at least 60 years.

## The role of solar

Solar power is a major player in a sustainable energy plan. In sunny areas, many people have
installed panels on their roofs to help power air-conditioning, lighting, and other household
necessities and found that the panels pay for themselves. Research in solar collection and storage
should be a major effort around the world. Even in less sunny areas, there are a few expensive
houses that run 100% on solar power, using large battery banks to power them through the nights.

When it comes to powering New York City through the night or manufacturing factories and computer
datacenters 24/7, solar has major challenges. Well-funded office
buildings and residential areas can find much benefit from solar power, but we will struggle to rely on it
alone. As is often said on the news these days, there is no silver bullet, all clean energy must
ally and work together.

## Non-photovoltaic solar

The energy from the sun can be used in other ways that by converting light to electricity in solar
panels. In fact, wind and hydroelectric power are both forms of solar power<sup>[<a
href="{% link solar-power.md %}" onmouseover="domTT_activate(this, event, 'width','200','caption',
'Note', 'content', 'The sun heats the Earth unevenly and causes pressure gradients, which give rise
to winds. As for hydroelectric, the sun evaporated water and lifted it to high elevations in clouds,
from which it then rained or snowed it down. In fact, assuming the fossil fuels are decayed plant
matter, the only non-solar energies on Earth are geothermal (coming from radioactive decay and
residual Earth-formation heat), nuclear (from atoms forged in supernovae), and tidal (from the
earth-moon gravitational system).','trail', true);">*</a>]</sup>. Water can be heated by the sun and
used in showers. Heat can be reflected onto an engine that turns a turbine, generating electricity.
Well-designed buildings can use the greenhouse effect for passive heating on colder days.
