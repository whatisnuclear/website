Sometimes it takes a bunch of factoids to get a point across. However, factoids
can be misleading since they can hide many of the implications of reality. Here
we present some of the astonishing factoids of nuclear power and attempt to
discuss them realistically and without (too much) bias.

Also, we are making available our spreadsheet used to calculate these factoids.

## Factoid 1: Energy Density

A kilogram of coal can run a 100W lightbulb for about 4 days while a kilogram
of natural uranium can run it for 182 years! If you enrich uranium up to
weapons grade, a kilogram can then run the lightbulb for over 24,000 years! Put
in better perspective, that kilogram of rock can power the entire USA for 177
seconds (almost 3 minutes!).

## Factoid 2: Recycling Nuclear Waste

If we took all the nuclear waste that was sitting around in the USA today from
the past 50 years of running reactors and recycled it, we could use it to power
the entire USA for about 93 years without mining anything else.

## Factoid 3: Waste per person

If all power in the USA came from conventional nuclear reactors, each American
would be responsible for generating 40 grams of nuclear waste per year.
That&rsquo;s the same as 7 US quarters weigh. If breeder reactors were used, it
could be as low as 4 grams. For comparison, each American is currently
responsible for about 10,000 kg of carbon emissions directly into the
atmosphere from electric plants per year, not to mention particulates and many
toxins. Nuclear waste, on the other hand stays out of the biosphere.

## Factoid 4: Amount of Uranium

At current demand, we can run the world fleet of nuclear reactors for about 220
years with expected uranium reserves on Earth.

## Factoid 5: Land use

To replace a regular 1 GW nuclear power plant with 33% efficient solar power in
Michigan, you&rsquo;re going to need 6.2 square miles of space. To do so in
Arizona, you need 4.0 square miles.

## Factoid 6: Scale of energy usage

To store the amount of energy a single typical nuclear power plant generates in
one night, you would have to lift 44 fully loaded Nimitz-class aircraft
carriers to the top of the Burj Dubai (818 meters) during the day and slowly
let them fall on a pulley, spinning generators.

<h2 id="disfueldensity">Factoid 1: Energy Density</h2>
There are a couple issues with this statement. Firstly, it is a factoid of
scale. You probably can&rsquo;t actually generate 100W of electricity with a
kilogram of wood nor with a kilogram of uranium. You need a big power plant to
do these things. But big power plants can power a lot more than 1 light bulb.
The idea just to visualize how much energy is contained in each material.
Secondly, this factoid assumes 100% efficiency in converting between heat and
electricity. Typical power plants usually only get about 33% due to laws of
thermodynamics. So you may have to divide the times quoted by about three to
get more realistic numbers. However, different types of power plants have
different efficiencies, and some conceptual high-temperature nuclear reactors
may be able to get up to 50%. So we left out the conversions to give you a
better feel of how much energy is inherently stored in materials.

<h2 id="disrecycle">Factoid 2: Recycling Waste</h2>
While technically realistic, this factoid would require much to be done in
order to actually happen. Enough nuclear power plants to power the entire USA
would need to be built. Only nuclear reactors can run on nuclear waste, not
coal plants. The type of reactors needed would be breeder reactors, which do
exist, but have not been deployed commercially anywhere in the world on a large
scale. We would also need to build reprocessing plants capable of processing
all 47,000 tonnes of waste we have lying around.  All of this would be very
costly and would require a focused national effort. There would still be some
nuclear waste after all this recycling as well. Breeders can get rid of most of
the actinides, but there are no reactors that can get rid of fission products.
These typically remain dangerously radioactive for up to 300 years -
significantly shorter than the hundreds of thousands of years of typical
nuclear waste. At the end of it all, there would still be about the same mass
of nuclear waste, but it would have been used MUCH more efficiently, displaced
WAY more carbon/pollutants, and would decay to stability much faster than the
original waste.

<h2 id="diswasteperperson">Factoid 3: Waste per Person</h2>
Of course, the 40 grams of stuff are highly toxic. But the beauty is the toxic
stuff never spewed into the atmosphere like in fossil plants. We can contain
this stuff. This assumes no recycling or anything, just business as usual with
all nukes. Again, it would take a lot to replace all the coal plants with
nukes. Wind and solar and hydro can help out here! Let&rsquo;s do it!

<h2 id="disamountofu">Factoid 4: Amount of Uranium</h2>

**UPDATE:** See our [Nuclear Sustainability post]({% link nuclear-sustainability.md %})

Uranium is not the most plentiful element on the planet. Won&rsquo;t this just
bring us into the same problem we have with oil? The answer is yes, unless we
recycle our fuel. Or if we find a way to extract Uranium cheaply from the sea
water (not economically feasible yet). If we <a
href="{% link recycling.md %}">recycle and breed</a>, the known uranium
reserves effectively go up by a factor of at least 8, taking us into the 16,000
year range. If we find a way to get Uranium out of the ocean, we're talking
hundreds of thousands of years. Also, nuclear reactors can operate on the
element Thorium instead of Uranium, which gives us even more time. So, this is
certainly something to worry about if we decide to build a lot of nuclear
plants soon, but it just means we have to do things correctly.

<h2 id="dislanduse">Factoid 5: Land Use</h2>
Keep in mind 33% efficient solar cells are not commonplace yet. If you used
solar-thermal, you might be able to get 33% efficiency cheaply. The solar plant
would still require some kind of storage to provide power through the night.

<h2 id="disscale">Factoid 6: Scale of energy usage</h2>
The point here is that we use unfathomable amounts of energy, and when we talk
about storing energy from solar and wind, we need to keep this in mind if we
want to be realistic.
