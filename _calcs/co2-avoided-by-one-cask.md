In 2017, there were 3482 PWR assemblies discharged in the USA, initially
containing 1526.5 tonnes of uranium, and that on average the assemblies were
burned to 46.2 MWd/kgHM [[EIA](https://www.eia.gov/nuclear/spent_fuel/)]. HM
means heavy metal, and refers to the mass of initial uranium of the fresh
assembly. This means that a single average 2017 PWR assembly gave out 21.5
GW-days of (thermal) energy.

    units -1 "1526.5 tonnes * 46.2 MW*day/kg/3282" "GW*day"
    21.488208

PWRs are about 32% thermally efficient, so those thermal GW-days are roughly
equivalent to 6.9 GW-days of electricity, or 1.7e8 kWh.

    units -1 "1526.5 tonnes * 46.2 MW*day/kg/3282 * 0.32" "kW*hour"
    1.6502944e+08

A typical dry cask (e.g. HI-STORM 100) holds 24 discharged PWR fuel assemblies
[[HOLTEC](https://holtecinternational.com/innovation/technical-papers/an-overview-of-hi-storm-hi-stars-metcon-conjugate/)].
Thus, an average dry cask full of PWR spent fuel represents about 4e9 kWh of
electricity.

    units -1 "1526.5 tonnes * 46.2 MW*day/kg/3282 * 0.32 * 24" "kW*hour"
    3.9607066e+09

Each kWh of nuclear electricity saves (490-12) = 478 grams of CO₂ (equivalent)
over gas, full lifecycle [[Schlomer
2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf)].
Thus, a single dry cask represents a savings of 1.9 million tonnes of CO₂-eq!!

    units -1 "1526.5 tonnes * 46.2 MW*day/kg/3282 * 0.32 * 24 * ((490-12) grams/(kW*hour))"  "million tonnes"
    1.8932177

(Older spent fuel had lower average burnup but displaced coal instead of gas, so that's a similar result)
