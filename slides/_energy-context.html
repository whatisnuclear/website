      The formal definition of energy is "the ability to do work". In practice,
      if we can enlist machines powered by some form of energy, we can get what
      we need to survive and thrive without having to work so hard. Rather than
      farming all day every day, energy allows a small fraction of people to
      farm, allowing everyone else to farm only if they choose to. That freedom
      to choose is a luxury of a high-energy lifestyle.

    <h3>Quality of life is correlated with energy use</h3>
    <img title="HDI chart" class="r-stretch" src="/img-slide/hdi.jpg" />
    <p class="small">Plot by A. Alhajri</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Quality of life is hard to quantify, but the UN has attempted to do so
      with the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines life expectancy,
      education, and GDP. When you plot it vs. per capita electricity use, you
      see these two strong asymptotes. On the flat one you see the US and
      Norway. Here, we could reduce our energy usage a little bit without having
      a big impact on our lives. But on the low energy line, we can see that a
      tiny bit of extra energy is correlated with a massive improvement in
      quality of life. This correlation does not imply causation, but is very
      strong.

      It must be acknowledged that fossil fuels have driven the industrial
      revolution. Before coal came into large use, forests were being clear-cut
      to make charcoal.
