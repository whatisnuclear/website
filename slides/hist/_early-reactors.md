      from October, 1944 where a longer discussion of their views of future
      reactors is recorded. They thought pressurized water would lead to
      corrosion issues at high temperature and considered liquid metal
      (specifically lead-bismuth) to be the most promising coolant. Written 5
      days after Hanford B came online.

### Four Foundational Reactors

Proposed in 1947 to be completed in the early 1950s.

- Fast reactor — A fast reactor to explore the possibilities of breeding (now known as EBR-1)
- Navy thermal reactor — a prototype for submarine propulsion (now known as STR or S1W)
- Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) — A testing facility to investigate potential materials
  to be used in power reactor construction. The resistance of materials to the environment
  required for power production was the primary challenge of power reactor development.
- Knolls intermediate reactor — to explore the possibilities of breeding and to develop usable
  power

    <h3>The Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR-1)</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-8" markdown="1">

- In 1946, Walter Zinn designed a proof-of-principle for breeding
- It was thought that uranium was very scarce, so breeders would be the only option for economical civilian power.
- EBR-1 was hooked to a generator and made the first significant amount of nuclear electricity
- It also proved that a conversion ratio >1.0 was possible
  - They didn't consider it a true breeder because it used U-235

- Intended to be 1st industrial/commercial power reactor
- Sodium-cooled, beryllium-moderated: intermediate-speed neutrons
- Supposed to breed and make commercial power
- On April 15, 1950, was repurposed as a submarine prototype because:
  - Technical challenges
  - Darkening relationships with the USSR
- Ended up as the S1G, the prototype for the USS Seawolf
- Large dome in NY remains

- 1 MWe portable PWR
- Manufactured and tested in a factory,
- Disassembled into 16 modules,
- Air-lifted to the closest airfield by C-130
- Trucked to site, re-assembled
- Direct air cooling, (no water supply)
- No field welding was needed for re-assembly.
- Could be operated by a crew of 2.

  <h3>Hard lessons from PM-1</h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12" markdown="1">

- The reactor was difficult to perform maintenance on because of its compactness.
  The operators recommend designing the next microreactor with maintenance
  requirements satisfied first, and then compactness requirements
- The conventional steam plant cause roughly half of the unplanned outages
  and required a lot of maintenance, leading the authors to suggest that
  perhaps a non-steam approach is needed at this small scale (e.g. other
  energy conversion systems).
- The nuclear instrumentation system was oversensitive and overcomplicated
  for a field plant.
- The HVAC system and building design were wholly inadequate
- It was difficult to maintain qualified staff to operate and maintain the reactor
- The reactor was used as a training reactor for crews headed to Antarctica to
  operate the sister plant PM-3A, which reduced PM-1's overall performance.
