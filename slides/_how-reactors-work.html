      In the beginning, one way or another, a bunch of energy was packed into
      heavy nuclei in great cataclysmic actions such as supernova and neutron
      star mergers. These made things like nuclear fuel atoms billions of years
      ago.

      Now, we can go outside with a Geiger counter and wave it around and fine
      these same atoms that were forged so long ago in cosmic furnaces. They are
      sitting in our rocks and in the sea. (This is a good time to whip out a
      Geiger counter and uranium mineral if you have one).

      Uranium is found in nature with 2 isotopes. 99.3% of it is Uranium-238.
      The rest is Uranium-235 with fewer neutrons. They are chemically
      identical, but only U-235 readily splits and releases energy in a power
      plant.

      Generally, we want to increase the fraction of U-235, and we do so by
      spinning it really fast so that the heavier atoms move preferentially to
      the outside. This process is called enrichment.

      Given enriched uranium, we then fabricate the fuel into ceramic pellets

      The assemblies are assembled together into a core that is big enough to
      sustain a nuclear chain reaction. Every 18 or 24 months, nuclear plants
      shut down and open their lid to add new fuel and remove old. This is a

    <aside class="notes">
      A neutron chain reaction occurs when one neutron fissions one nucleus,
      releasing the cosmic energy and also a few extra neutrons. These extra
      neutrons go on to split a neighboring nucleus, and the chain reaction
      continues. This allows us to access that slowly-bubbling-out energy from
      the ore much faster, enabling us to do useful things like make
      electricity.

      We use a nuclear power plant to convert all the heat being released in the
      core into usable electricity. To do this, we just pump a coolant
      (typically water) through the core, where it heats up and generates steam.
      The steam blows through a turbine, like a giant pinwheel, which spins. The
      shaft is hooked to a generator that has magnets on it. The spinning
      magnets push electrons through coils which are attached to power lines and
      come to your house, where the moving electrons can be used in your
      appliances and lights.

      underground where they will remain until all the residual radiation has
      been emitted.
