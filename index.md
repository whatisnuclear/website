    Nuclear power plants produce sustainable and reliable clean-air heat and electricity
    with almost no lifecycle carbon emissions. The downsides must be weighed against these benefits.
    Here you will learn about the nuances behind nuclear power and nuclear energy in general.

In the late 1930s, we discovered that some particularly large atoms found in
nature can be split into two (or *fission*), releasing a shocking amount of
energy as heat. Because the energy emerges from the atomic nucleus,
we call it *nuclear energy*.

When these atoms are arranged properly in a machine called a nuclear reactor,
each splitting nucleus can induce its neighbors to split in turn, creating a
controlled chain reaction.  Reactors can convert the released nuclear heat into
electricity, shaft horsepower (to power ships), building heating,
desalinated water, hydrogen, and many other things useful to human
civilization.

Today, about 430 commercial nuclear power plants worldwide produce around 400 GW
of electricity, enough to power 400 million average households. About one-fifth
of the USA's electricity comes from nuclear power, which represents about half
of the country's zero-carbon electricity.

Nuclear energy is controversial due to concerns about radiation. Public support varies
geographically, but nuclear is generally among the least popular forms of energy.

        Because nuclear fuel contains millions of times more energy per mass than anything else, it is
        possible to keep all the byproducts accounted for and out of the biosphere, in strong
        contrast to fossil and biofuels which release much of their combustion wastes into the
        air, causing severe health and environmental problems.

The following table shows how long a 100 Watt

When heavy atoms split and release energy, the two smaller atoms remaining (called
*fission products*) are often left with some extra energy to give off. This energy is
released over a period of time (the longest-lived waste lasting 100,000+ years) in the
form of energetic particles called [*radiation*]({% link radioactivity.md %}). The high radiation is
hazardous and must be kept isolated from the biosphere. We have not yet agreed on
what should be done with this high-level nuclear waste.

  We know how to deal with nuclear waste safely. The Finns simply chose to go
  ahead and solve their nuclear waste issue and built the repository at Onkalo.  We have good experience with deep
  geologic disposal in salt deposits that have been stable for 250 million years. Research in deep borehole technology is
  also looking promising. Finally, if we close the fuel cycle and [recycle spent fuel]({% link recycling.md %}), then it
  decays to safe levels in several hundred years rather than hundreds of thousands.
  Furthermore, despite the fear, few people, if any, have ever been injured by stored
  commercial nuclear waste.

Nuclear reactors are generally large and complex, with lots of reinforced concrete and nuclear-grade

## A nuanced reality
Nuclear fission's ability to responsibly produce global-scale, 24/7, (nearly)
carbon-free energy is unmatched among known technologies.  

Next-generation reactor designs exist that can further reduce waste, improve
safety, increase proliferation resistance, and reduce costs. Even if someone
doesn't support current nuclear, it is difficult for them to disregard all possible
improvements. We humans have made impressive accomplishments before.

Of all the known energy resources, nuclear is perhaps the most passionately
debated and least understood.  Our goal is to explain what makes some people so
excited and supportive, and what makes others so passionately opposed. There are
many sides to each story. Let's explore them deeper.

## Fission and Fusion

There are two fundamental nuclear processes considered for energy production: fission and fusion. 

* **Fission** is the energetic splitting of large atoms such as Uranium or Plutonium into two
  smaller atoms, called fission products. To split an atom, you have to hit it with a neutron.
  Several neutrons are also released which can go on to split other nearby atoms, producing a nuclear
  chain reaction of sustained energy release. This nuclear reaction was the first of the two to be
  discovered. All commercial <a href="{% link reactors.md %}">nuclear power plants</a> in operation
  use this reaction to generate heat which they turn into electricity.
* **Fusion** is the combining of two small atoms such as Hydrogen or Helium to produce heavier atoms
  and energy. These reactions can release more energy than fission without producing as many
  radioactive byproducts. Fusion reactions occur in the sun, generally using Hydrogen as fuel and
  producing Helium as waste (fun fact: Helium was discovered in the sun and named after the Greek Sun
  God, Helios). This reaction has not been commercially developed yet and is a serious research
  interest worldwide, due to its promise of nearly limitless, low-pollution, and non-proliferative
  energy. Read more at [our fusion page]({% link fusion.md %}).
