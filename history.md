This page goes through a condensed version of the history of nuclear energy. Of course, there are
many developments and people who are not covered.

## Early discoveries

No scientific progress ever really _starts_. Rather, it builds on the work of
countless other discoveries. Since we have to start somewhere, this story will
start in Germany, in 1895, where a fellow named Roentgen was experimenting with
cathode rays in a glass tube that he had sucked the air out of. At one point, he
had the device covered but noticed that the photographic plates off to the side
were lighting up when the device was energized. He realized that he was looking
at a new kind of ray, and called it what any reasonable physicist would call an
unknown: the X-ray. He systematically studied these rays and took the first
x-ray photo of his wife&rsquo;s hand two weeks later, thereby becoming the
father of modern medical diagnostics.

Soon after in France, in 1896, a guy named Becquerel noticed that if he left
uranium salts sitting on photographic plates, they would expose even though no
cathode ray tube was energized. The energy must have been coming from inside the
salts themselves. Marie Curie and her husband Pierre studied the phenomenon and
isolated two new elements that exhibited this spontaneous energy production:
Polonium and Radium. They named the phenomenon _radioactivity_.

In England, Ernest Rutherford starts studying radioactivity and discovers that
there are two types of rays that come out that are different from x-rays. He
calls them alpha- and beta- radiation. He later discovers the shocking fact that
the vast majority of the mass of atoms is concentrated in their centers, and
thus discovers the atomic nucleus. He is widely regarded today as the father of
nuclear physics. He later discovers gamma radiation. In 1920, he theorizes the
existence of a neutral particle in the nucleus called a neutron, though there is
no evidence that neutrons exist yet.

In 1932, Chadwick reads some published results from the Curie&rsquo;s kid, Irene
Joliot-Curie that says gamma radiation was found to knock protons out of wax.
Disbelieving, he suspects they are seeing Rutherford&rsquo;s neutrons and does
experiments to prove this, thus discovering the neutron.

## Fission and the bomb

With neutrons around, everyone&rsquo;s shooting them at various nuclides. Soon
enough, Hahn and Strassman shoot them at uranium atoms and see some strange
behavior which Lise Meitner and her nephew Frisch identify as the splitting of
the atom, releasing much energy. They name it fission, after binary fission in
biology.

Szilard recognizes fission as a potential way to form a chain reaction (which he
had been considering for a long time). He and Fermi do some neutron
multiplication studies and see that it is indeed possible. They go home, knowing
that the world is about to change forever.

Szilard, Wigner, and Teller write a letter to President Roosevelt, warning of
nuclear weapons, and have Einstein sign it and send it (he was more famous).
Roosevelt authorizes a small study into uranium. In 1942, Fermi successfully
created the first man-made nuclear chain reaction in a squash court under the
stadium at the University of Chicago. The Manhattan project kicked into full
gear. Two types of bombs were pursued simultaneously, one made with enriched
uranium, and the other made with plutonium. Giant secret cities were built very
quickly. The one in Oak Ridge, TN had a reactor that created the first
gram-quantities of plutonium for study, but its main task was to enrich uranium.
The one in Hanford, WA is the site of plutonium production reactors (the first
high-power nuclear reactors) and plutonium extraction chemistry plants. Another,
in Los Alamos, NM is the site where the technology that turns weapons materials
into weapons is developed. Both paths to the bomb are successful. The more
uncertain design, the plutonium implosion device (like Fat Man) is successfully
tested at the Trinity site in New Mexico in July, 1945.

The decision is made to drop Little Boy and Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
Japan on August 6th and 9th, 1945. The cities are devastated, with up to 250,000
people dead. Japan surrenders unconditionally 6 days later, on August 15th, 1945. This is the first time the public realizes that the US has been developing
bombs.

## Fission energy expands in application

An experimental liquid-metal cooled reactor in Idaho called EBR-I was attached
to a generator in 1951, producing the first nuclear-generated electricity. But
before civilian power plants came to be, Admiral Rickover pushed to use reactors
to power submarines, since they wouldn&rsquo;t need to refuel, or to use oxygen
for combustion. The USS Nautilus launched in 1954 as the first nuclear-powered
submarine. Soon after, the Soviet Union opens the first non-military,
electricity producing reactor. Based on the submarine reactor design, the
Shippingport reactor opens in 1957 as the first commercial reactor in the USA.

## Nuclear energy expands and stagnates

Through the 60s and 70s, lots of nuclear reactors are built for making
electricity, using designs very similar to those made for the submarines. They
work well and produce cheap, emission-free electricity with a very low mining
and transportation footprint. A nuclear powered future is envisioned by many. In
1974, France decided to make a major push for nuclear energy, and ended up with
75% of their electricity coming from nuclear reactors. The US built 104
reactors, and got about 20% of its electricity from them. Eventually, labor
shortages and construction delays started bringing the cost of nuclear reactors
up, slowing their growth.

The 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl accident further
slowed the deployment of nuclear reactors. Tighter regulations brought costs
higher. The 1986 passive safety tests at EBR-II prove that advanced reactor
designs (besides the ones originally used to make submarines) can be
substantially safer. These tests have major failure occur with no control rods
inserted and the reactors shut themselves down automatically.

In 1994, the Megatons to Megawatts treaty with Russia is signed to downblend
nuclear warheads into reactor fuel. Eventually, 10% of US electricity comes from
dismantled nuclear weapons.

In the late &rsquo;90s and &rsquo;00s, the phenomenal safety record of the US commercial reactor fleet (0 deaths) and smooth operation of reactors
combined with ongoing worries of global climate change due to carbon emissions brings about substantial talk of a &quot;nuclear renaissance&quot;,
where new builds might start up substantially again. Meanwhile, strong interest in Asia strengthens and ambitious plans to build large fleets
are made to satisfy growing energy needs without adding more fossil fuel.

On March, 2011, a large earthquake and tsunami inundate the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi. Backup diesel generators fail and the decay heat
cannot be cooled. Fuel melts, hydrogen builds up and explodes (outside of containment). Radiation is released, but much of it goes out to sea
instead of into populated area. No people expected to die from radiation dose.

## Going forward

March, 2013, famous climate scientist James Hansen co-publishes a paper from NASA computing that, even with worst case estimates of nuclear accidents,
nuclear energy as a whole has saved 1.8 million lives and counting by offsetting the air-pollution related deaths that come from fossil fuel plants.

September 2013, Voyager I enters interstellar space, 36 years after its launch. It is powered by a Plutonium-238 radioisotopic thermal generator.
